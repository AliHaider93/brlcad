	// BRL-CAD's combs do not have internal guarantees of instance
	// uniqueness within a comb tree - i.e., it is structurally possible
	// for two absolutely identical combination instances to exist
	// simultaneously in the same comb.  Generally speaking this is not a
	// desired condition, but because it is not precluded we must make
	// arrangements to handle it.
	//
	// As long as QgInstances are unique within their parent comb's
	// immediate tree, they are globally unique - the parent is a unique
	// object, so even if an otherwise identical instance exists in another
	// comb the difference is clear from a data standpoint.  Therefore, in
	// order to produce a QgInstance that is globally unique, we must
	// provide a mechanism for encoding that uniqueness at the QgInstance
	// level.
	//
	// The solution is quite simple - a simple incremented instance counter
	// that gets incremented each time another duplicate of a particular
	// comb instance is encountered within the same comb's immediate tree.
	// For the instance in question, the current counter value is assigned
	// to the icnt variable.  Since we are incrementing each time an
	// instance is encountered, this produces a QgInstance that can be
	// identified uniquely.  Because we must have global knowledge of the
	// comb tree's contents to generate the counts, we must assign these
	// values during the tree walk which creates the instances.
	//
	// There is a limit to how "neatly" we can associate a QgInstance with
	// an exact on-disk comb tree instance - if a tree with multiple such
	// instances is edited, icnt == 3 in the original tree may become icnt
	// == 2 or icnt == 4 in the next version.  If we want to preserve the
	// "open" and "closed" states of such instances through editing, we
	// would have to take particular care with bookkeeping to index which
	// duplicates are open and adjust those indices to reflect the changes
	// made to the comb's tree during an edit.  Whether we would actually
	// match the original instances even then depends on the details of the
	// comb tree storage and walking - it is unlikely that the code
	// complexity inherent in such tracking is worthwhile given this case
	// is rare and a borderline modeling error in the first place.

	// The following value holds the index of the active flags array to
	// check when determining if this object is active.  I.e. activity is
	// checked by looking at:
	//
	// ctx->active_flags[instance->obj->active_ind];
	//
	// We want to record an instance's active state in this fashion because
	// it lets us use active_flags to iteratively set flags "up" the tree
	// hierarchy (i.e. for each active QgInstance, set its parent's
	// QgInstance flag as active.  Count currently set active_flags
	// entries, and if that count is not equal to the prior count repeat
	// the process.  When no new flags are set, we have identified all
	// QgInstances activated by the current selection, and thus each QgItem
	// will know enough to be able to tell the drawing delegate how it
	// needs to display itself.  We can also trivially clear the
	// active_flags at the beginning of each selection action by clearing
	// the active_flags array.
	//
	// Note that when doing such flag setting, it doesn't matter whether
	// the QgInstance has any associated QgItems.  Even if it doesn't,
	// somewhere further up the tree a parent comb will need to display
	// its state change and the assignments must take place in order to
	// propagate the necessary awareness up to the visible level.

// QgItems correspond to the actual Qt entries displayed in the view.  If a
// comb is reused in multiple places in the tree a QgInstance may be referenced
// by multiple QgItems, but each QgItem corresponds uniquely to a single string
// of directory pointers, ops, matrices and (if needed icnt values) from a
// series of QgInstance structures generated by walking comb trees.  A single
// QgItem being selected may activate multiple QgItems by virtue of their using
// the same QgInstance as the selected QgItem (this reflects the impact any
// changes will have on the database contents) but from the Qt perspective the
// unique selection item is the QgItem.  If the QgItem is changed (added,
// moved, deleted, etc.) other QgItems with the same QgInstance will have to be
// separately addressed to reflect the same changes.
//
// A QgItem will store parents and children, but remember that both of those
// relationships are informed by the QgInstance relationships rather than directly
// representing them.  A QgItem always has a unique parent, even if its QgInstance
// is associated with multiple active QgItems elsewhere in the tree.  The children
// array reflects the open/closed state of the item - if it is closed, the chilren
// array is empty even though the comb it corresponds to may have many children.
// It is only when the QgItem is opened that the inst QgInstance is queried for
// its children and new QgItems based on the QgInstance children are created.
// Conversely, QgItem children are destroyed when the QgItem is closed, even
// though the QgInstances are not.

	// QgInstances will save memory.

	// Hierarchy items
	//
	// One of the subtle points of a .g hierarchy representation is that a
	// QgInstance may be locally unique, but not globally unique.  For
	// example, if comb A has underneath it two different instances of comb
	// B using different placement matrices, and B is defined using C:
	//
	// A
	//   u [M1] B
	//            u C
	//                u D
	//   u [M2] B
	//            u C
	//                u D
	//
	// D has only one unique QgInstance definition in this hierarchy - IDN
	// matrix union of D into C - but that instance has TWO manifestations
	// in the overall tree that are NOT the same model items by virtue of
	// having different B parent instances further up in the hierarchy:
	// Au[M1]B and Au[M2]B.
	//
	// To with this the primary model hierarchy is an items hierarchy which
	// holds QgItems that encode a reference to a QgInstance and the
	// parent/child data specific to an individual place in the hierarchy.
	// It is a QgItem, not a QgInstance, which can correspond to a row in a
	// Qt abstract model.  Unlike QgInstances, QgItems are created lazily in
	// response to view requests, working from a seed set created from the
	// top level objects in a database.
	//
	// The seed set is the set of objects with no parents in the hierarchy.
	// (What users of MGED think of as the "tops" set.)  This set may change
	// after each database edit, but there will always be at least one object
	// in a valid .g hierarchy that has no parent.
	//
	// TODO - check what tops does about a database with a cyclic definition
	// of an otherwise top level comb...  I suspect in that case we may have
	// to break the cycle to generate a pseudo-tops object...

	// Activity flags (used for relevance highlighting) need to be updated
	// whenever a selection changes.  We define one flag per QgInstance,
