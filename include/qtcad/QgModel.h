 *
 * Abstract Qt model of a BRL-CAD .g database
 *
 * Qt uses a Model/View approach to visualizing information such as trees, and
 * for BRL-CAD hierarchy visualization the most natural fit in Qt is to define
 * a Qt Model that corresponds to the .g data.  There are challenges in
 * defining such a model that aren't immediately apparent, and they complicate
 * the implication considerably.  In essence it is necessary to translate
 * BRL-CAD's data concepts to those needed by Qt and vice versa.  To attempt
 * to articulate the motivations for the model as defined here, the following
 * discussion tries to detail the issues encountered.
 *
 * The most fundamental difficulty is that comb object instances - the primary
 * hierarchical unit defined in .g files - are not necessarily globally unique
 * in the .g file. To illustrate this, consider a combination A that has
 * underneath it two different instances of a combination B using different
 * placement matrices (M1 and M2). B is in turn defined using combination C
 * which is defined using object D:
 *
 * A
 *   u [M1] B
 *            u C
 *                u D
 *   u [M2] B
 *            u C
 *                u D
 *
 * The objects A, B, C and D are unique (all .g objects are uniquely named,
 * which ensures uniqueness in at least one sense) but the Qt model hierarchy
 * requires the expression of comb INSTANCES, not objects.  Moreover, it needs
 * those instances to be not just locally unique, but GLOBALLY unique.  The
 * union of D into C using an identity matrix is unique with respect to B, but
 * not when B is combined with A multiple times.  That inclusion of B into A
 * (which is completely non-local as far as C's or B's definitions are
 * concerned) results in TWO manifestations of CuD in the overall model that
 * are NOT the same model item, despite mapping to exactly the same .g data.
 * Or, stated another way, we have multiple items of CuD in the hierarchy:
 * Au[M1]BuCuD and Au[M2]BuCuD.  However, from the .g data perspective, CuD IS
 * a unique combination instance - it is stored only once, and any edit to C or
 * D will impact BOTH Au[M1]BuCuD and Au[M2]BuCuD. This means that .g comb
 * instances cannot, by themselves, map directly to items in a Qt model.
 *
 * Conversely, in a Qt .g model, if a Qt item which is going to express .g
 * instance editing the mode must be prepared to cope with changes having non
 * local side effects - i.e. any change to one item can potentially change an
 * arbitrary number of additional items, based on what else in the .g database
 * is referencing the object being changed.
 *
 * The approach taken to cope with these issues is to conceptually split the
 * wrapping of .g comb instances into two parts - a QgInstance that corresponds
 * to one unique parent+bool_op+matrix+child instance in a .g combination tree,
 * and a QgItem which corresponds to a globally unique instance of a QgInstance.
 * So, in the above example, CuD would be expressed as a QgInstance, and the
 * Au[M1]BuCuD QgItem would reference the CuD QgInstance to connect the .g
 * database information to the unique model hierarchy item.  Likewise, the
 * Au[M2]BuCuD QgItem would reference the same QgInstance, despite being a
 * different item in the model.
 *
 * QgInstances are created to reflect the .g database state, and they are what
 * is updated as a direct consequence of callbacks registered with the low
 * level database I/O routines.  QgItems must then be updated (or
 * added/removed) in response to QgInstance changes.  The only QgItems that
 * will be populated by default are the top level items - all others will be
 * lazily created in response as the user specifies which combs to open in
 * the view.  (The latter is necessary for large databases, which may have
 * very large and deep hierarchies.)
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * NOTE - the QtCADTree model has many of the pieces we will need,
 * but has limitations.  The intent here is to start "from the
 * ground up" and be guided by the Qt editable example:
 *
 * https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-itemviews-editabletreemodel-example.html
 *
 * Also investigate https://wiki.qt.io/Model_Test to see if it may be
 * useful for this code.

	// Au[M1]B and Au[M2]B.
	//
	// To with this the primary model hierarchy is an items hierarchy which
	// holds QgItems that encode a reference to a QgInstance and the
	// parent/child data specific to an individual place in the hierarchy.
	// It is a QgItem, not a QgInstance, which can correspond to a row in a
	// Qt abstract model.  Unlike QgInstances, QgItems are created lazily in
	// response to view requests, working from a seed set created from the
	// top level objects in a database.
	//
	// The seed set is the set of objects with no parents in the hierarchy.
	// (What users of MGED think of as the "tops" set.)  This set may change

	// in a valid .g hierarchy that has no parent.
