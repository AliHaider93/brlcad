/**
  Qt widget that provides an interactive console - you can send text to the
  console by calling printString() and receive user input by connecting to the
  executeCommand() slot.

  Note:  Qt's signals and slots mechanism helps to make a robust widget for
  multithreaded inputs, since input strings to the console are coming in via
  signals and written by slots.  Users should not attempt to manipulate the
  underlying QPlainTextEdit widget directly.
