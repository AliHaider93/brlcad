    Fixed Archer's resetting of perspective angle to 0
    
    Looks like commit af045f79 did end up addressing a problem in Archer -
    if you brought up the Preferences dialog, went to the display tab, and
    adjusted the perspective angle, once off of zero (orthogonal view) you
    wouldn't have previously been able to restore it to that value.

    Remove nburst rewrite of burst code
    
    Burst is now deprecated - there's not much point in trying to maintain a
    proposed modernized replacement for the old code, since no further work
    is forthcoming.  Note remove in NEWS, since nburst was mentioned in
    7.32.0.

    extern arary declarations shouldn't typically specify size.
    
    it masks any inconsistency between definition and declaration, akin to a size cast, resulting in runtime badness.  if size is needed, general trick is to define size where the array is defined (as a separate symbol, bleh), and provide a declaration in the public header as well.

    gracefully handle bogus arcs instead of potentially introducing a dramatic behavior change.
    
    it was proceeding before, which means potentially failing an entire extrude that was working.  here the intent seems to be an arc that degraded to a circle (which should be fine) or an arc with numerics that got wonky due to precision.  instead we clamp and proceed as we would have before but without bad math.

    questioning this change as it seems to expose the API design to an implementation detail unneccesarily, making it more complicated to use the API in the process.  asking apps to track their argv0 for sake of crash reporting is not an intended or desirable design, and it doesn't scale well.

    slew of mged changes were done without updating the docs.
    
    that by definition made them user-visible, but alas, any damage is done.  the docs should at least get updated.

    note the mged features removed, sans editorialization.
    
    these should not have been removed on a patch release, given the nature and extent of changes, and the simple reason that doing so violated CHANGES (no notice given, removal incomplete, no alternatives for some)

    screengrab/overlay framebuffer options documented in 7.32.0
    
    Chris ran these down - the upshot of the changes was to add the options
    to screengrab and overlay, rather than adding new commands or removing
    existing commands.  screengrab and overlay man pages document the new
    options.  Still need to consider how to approach fb2pix et. al. at some
    point, but not currently a priority.

    run the command without specifying.

    emacs key bindings in shell context have nothing to do with emacs...
    
    need to discuss impact/alternatives.  running btclsh in emacs isn't a
    substitute for the key bindings as they have nothing to do with each
    other... that's kind of like saying we're removing blender mouse
    bindings because we found a way to run mged commands in blender.
    non sequitur.
    
    emacs key bindings are merely the canonical name for default bindings
    provided by essentially all shell environments (including sh, bash,
    zsh, etc) where, for example, ctrl-a/ctrl-e goes to beginning/end of
    line.  to remove them means removing btclsh and bwish CLI navigation
    without substution or benefit to users.  it degrades and devalues them
    arguably to irrelevance.

    Replace wdb_close altogether with db_close
    
    With the new setup, the meat of wdb_close is now just db_close.  Leaving
    a wdb_close in, but replace all current uses in the code with the direct
    db_close call.  Clarifies intent and simplifies.
    
    Looking at 7.32.6 uses of wdb_close, I think I've got all the spurious
    calls introduced during the wdb rework removed - we only want the close
    operation when we're intending to close the dbip itself.

    MGED's wdb_reopen operates directly on the wdbp dbip pointer - adjust its logic.

    If keep is opening an existing dbip, do the db_close after processing.

    wdb_close needs to db_close for wdb_fopen
    
    The wdb_fopen and wdb_fopen_v functions do an all-up db_create, which
    means conceptually they are managing the dbip themselves and need
    wdb_close to also take down the dbip.  We don't want that when we're
    doing db_open based dbip work, so we let wdb_close know via a flag that
    it is responsible for doing db_close when the wdb API is assuming
    ownership of the dbip.
    
    Josh noticed this manifesting when a .g created with a GED keep command
    produced a .g file that couldn't be moved until MGED was closed (which
    released the file.)

    Actually, if we're going to do full open/close operations for intermediate steps, the temp file won't work for garbage_collect.

    Make a stab at enabling the librt datum unit test
    
    Originally this test was disabled, because the bu_temp_file trick it
    uses didn't work reliably cross platform - in some cases fclose on the
    FILE pointer immediately deletes the temp file, with no opportunity for
    the program to re-open it with a db_open.  So instead, we provide a db
    initialization routine that accepts the FILE pointer and does all
    necessary work without ever closing it.  Works on Ubuntu Linux, but
    needs cross platform testing.
    
    If this ends up working well, there are more places in the code where we
    should be using it - really, any time we need to create a temporary .g
    file.  The garbage_collect command is one obvious possibility, but there
    are very likely others...

    This is redundant right now with the second argv option to overlay, but
    it is setting the stage for the deprecation of that argv behavior in
    order to allow overlay to accept multiple plot files as inputs.  -N
    allows the original behavior to be achieved by supporting custom view
    object naming, once the current behavior is removed.

    Update man pages for brep command/subcommands
    
    The 7.32.6 release does have the current form of the BRep commands (the
    work to reorganize them is considerably older), but it looks like the
    man pages weren't adjusted or clarified much when that work was done.
    In part that was due to most of brep being a very low level command, not
    used much in day-to-day workflows. However, there are a few items like
    flip and valid that are of more frequent use to modelers, and when we do
    need things like plotting we really need them...  Go ahead and do some
    cleanup on the documentation.

    Comment out stub for brep weld subcommand
    
    This is still a feature we want - it is intended to help in cases where
    we end up with conversions that have individual surfaces which are
    physically located in space in such a way that they together define a
    closed volume, but lack the topological connections that constitute a
    proper BRep definition.  However, it's implementation is somewhat
    non-trivial and it's probably going to end up unimplemented until we hit
    a problem that requires it.

    possible solution to tcl IO 'puts' error
    
    It looks like the error was being caused by threads lingering after
    Tcl_UnregisterChannel incorrectly signaling the new write threads from
    Tcl_MakeFileChannel. Calling puts with an empty string immediately after
    unregistering/making a new channel for stdout and stderr appears to sync
    the cleanup and ensures puts is available for the current session.

    Set better management of rt_wdb I/O stream types
    
    MGED is opening two wdb streams on a single dbip - one inmem, and one
    disk (via libged).  In principle this isn't forbidden by the APIs, but
    it causes a practical difficulty in that db_i stores only one dbi_wdbp
    pointer.  If code expects its assigned wdbp to be present in
    dbip->dbi_wdbp and someone else assigns a new wdbp with a different type
    in a function call somewhere, Bad (and rather odd) things tend to
    happen.  libwdb I/O routines will start working differently than the
    caller expected them to, for no apparent reason.
    
    Upon examination, the dbi_wdbp pointer is really supposed to be regarded
    as private, and the main thing it controls is how read/write operations
    access data. (Separate experimentation in a branch proved that
    essentially all the other contents of rt_wdb can be successfully moved
    either down to db_i or up to libged/libtclcad/etc. - the type is the key
    to libwdb's behavioral changes.)  To handle the MGED scenario of
    multiple different simultaneous wdb stream types, we alter the logic to
    have db_open and db_close set up the four potentially needed stream
    types once, and manage them separately using different private pointers
    (this whole "private db_instance vars" setup needs to be moved to a
    hidden implementation struct, but that's for later...)
    
    This approach results in wdb_dbopen becoming a pass-through returning
    one of the four db_instance managed streams, which at first glance looks
    like it might be removing a potential ability of client codes to create
    and manage their own rt_wdb structures.   However, the need to keep the
    dbip and dbi_wdbp pointers in sync meant that was never a realistic
    possibility.  MGED's wdb_obj.c code referencing the rtg_headwdb global
    stores rt_wdb pointers in a list, but as near as I can tell this logic
    will always result in new rt_wdb pointers associated with new db_open
    calls, rather than expecting a new rt_wdb to reference the same dbip.
    
    The new approach also has the advantage of making each use of the wdbp
    clear as far as intent - rather than hoping dbi_wdbp is holding the
    right stream type for the job, the library or app requests exactly what
    it needs explicitly and locally.  wdb_close is currently a no-op -
    db_close will do the cleanup - but it is added in most cases anyway to
    express the intent of treating the wdb stream interface as a local
    phenomena rather than setting up global, db_i wide state.
    
    A consequence of this refactor was to expose a variety of direct uses of
    the "private" dbi_wdbp pointer, which are now replaced with calls to
    wdb_dbopen.  The next step is to look at libged's ged_wdbp - using this
    approach, it should be possible to dispense with it entirely in favor of
    dbip + wdb_dbopen.
    
    I note in passing that at the moment rt_wdb is being used to track
    counting and prefixing strings - as near as I can tell this logic is
    used only in libged commands, not in librt or libwdb.  We should
    consider whether those variables would make more sense living in libged
    as well.  Tolerance and resource variables, on the other hand, almost
    certainly belong with the dbip itself - in particular, moving resource
    from rt_wdb to db_instance will almost certainly be a major step towards
    removal of rt_uniresource as a global, and thanks to the rt_wdb struct
    holding a dbip pointer may even be minimally impacting.  (None of those
    changes are in this commit, however.)

    this represents a pretty huge change from an code and architecture perspective (and hundreds of commits of change), but hopefully not much if any affect on users and applications as indicated by testing.  code is more standards compliant, lots of memory and security issues fixed, some restructuring and renaming, and loads more.

    First cut at a libged garbage_collect cmd
    
    Since we need to look at the garbage_collect command anyway, go ahead
    and recast it as a libged command so it will be more widely available.
    Give the opportunity for mishap with this command it needs another set
    of eyes, and probably warrants some test cases as well so we can check
    it across all platforms more easily.  Approach taken is to do a low
    level transcription of the bu_external data, without unpacking further.

    use vectors in lieu of sets to retain object ordering
    
    std::sets order insertions, which results in objects being alphabatized after
    conversions. Continue to use sets to retain uniqueness but write the
    combs using a vector to preserve order.
    note that this will show some names being added/deleted when running a
    gdiff of the set implementation vs the vector implementation. This is
    due to the lookup ordering and renaming within the 'polish_output'
    section. When orphaned objects part of nested layers are encountered in this function it will
    rename according to the database ordering - since we have now changed the
    order additions/deletions are reported although all geometry is
    accounted for.

    Remove HIDDEN define in favor of plain 'static'
    
    In my experience the extra layer of the HIDDEN definition isn't
    particularly useful - if we're going to be static, we don't want to also
    have to worry about name conflicts if a build setting changes, and if
    the "don't inline" case is still useful it appears to come up very
    rarely.  Motivation for doing this now is that it looks like OpenMesh
    also has a HIDDEN definition that collides with ours...  There are
    probably other ways to handle that, but might as well use it as a prod
    to do the HIDDEN -> static scrub.

    disable regress-asc and regress-weight temporarily.
    
    this is the least invasive, least disruptive way to temporarily disable the regression failures that are being actively worked on and debugged.  it leaves the test binaries themselves in tact so debugging can continue.  getting time to finish testing and fixing the regression proper has been taking a while admist repeat ongoing interruptions.  getting the tests back online will help to ensure additional issues aren't introduced and CI can be useful again.
    
    intent remains to re-enable with prejudice as soon as possible as the regression failures are still release blockers.

    Set PERMISSIONS on file(COPY) to match CMake
    
    This use of the PERMISSIONS options has a downside - it sets ALL the
    file permissions, without preserving any of the pre-existing flags.
    It's resulting in executables not being runnable when they go through
    this logic path.  Work around it by trying to set all the flags to match
    what we would get out of default CMake file creation.
    
    This is an unfortunate limitation of file(COPY), and is further
    compounded by what as far as I can tell is an inability in CMake to read
    the existing permissions off the file portably. Thus we can't even read
    the permissions from the file to make an attempt to craft a permissions
    preserving copy command manually.  The only other option I know of would
    be to make a CMake function wrapper around execing the various platform
    specific commands to do this, and if this works I'd prefer to avoid
    having to create and manage that solution...

    rename rt/nmg.h to rt/nmg_conv.h
    
    this requires adapting headers in other places, but avoids situations where there seemed to be problems finding the right nmg.h header.  renaming to nmg_conv.h identified a handful of places where headers were not being included correctly and made two duplicate structs obvious (removed hitmiss and another).

    fix longstanding permissions denied errors building on windows.
    
    tcl's build on windows installs the msg files read-only, which causes problems during repeat compile+clean+compile or reconfigure cycles.  particularly with the default cmake ninja build in msvc2019, the errors are incessantly reported and can't be cleared.  here we ensure owner can read/write the files, which makes rebuilding happier.

    Back in 2014, I tried to switch away from throwing exceptions.

    Count our recursion depth and bail if too deep
    
    This is cheap, but other roads to avoiding crashing via robustness
    improvements are looking to be a lot of work, so let's see if this can
    keep us running in the meantime...  throw an exception if we recurse too
    deeply calling edge events.  We don't get a mesh if this happens, but
    hopefully we also don't crash.  Need to test with the non-scrubbed logic
    and real geometry, but does avoid wiping out with one of the scrubbed
    test cases.

    Grr.  Need to dive deeper into poly2tri failures
    
    NIST2 face 232 succeeds with a larger point adjustment,
    but crashes with a smaller one.  Conversely, NIST7-10 Solid1.r.s
    face 268 crashes with a larger point adjustment, but succeeds with
    a smaller.  Not immediately clear why one would succeed in one config
    and one in the other...

    algorithm.  Start exploring whether we can implement a similar approach.

    Work with libbu+BSON is stalled, and libbson is some work to integrate - the upstream build system doesn't lend itself to doing so.  Rather than update a currently unused dependency, remove and require a system version for development work.  Bundled version can be revisited and the integration modernized once libbu requires it.

    Remove unused files
    
    As far as I can tell, these files aren't used.  Remove them in
    preparation for trying to merge in upstream changes.
    
    Looking at netpbm's recent versions, we may have a problem...  We
    removed nstring from netpbm some years back due to license issues.  In
    the most recent version, it is still using a GPL license, and is
    definitely used in a number of places.  Not immediately clear how
    difficult it's going to be to identify and merge in upstream changes
    while keeping nstring out of the mix...

    Make a stab at incorporating a fix for Mac builds
    
    It looks as if there's an issue with the CMake code for PNG with modern
    XCode:
    https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1946
    https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/pull/403
    
    This commit makes a stab at adapting the version from
    https://github.com/libpng/libpng/pull/2
    
    onto our (somewhat simplified) png build.
    
    It looks as if libpng doesn't currently have much in the way of an
    active upstream (no new releases in a number of years), so will need to
    keep an eye out to see what the eventual solution is.

    Adjust how scene obj settings are propagated
    
    When selecting an LoD mesh, the highlighting wasn't getting propagated
    down to the view specific objects.  By default, we don't want the
    non-LoD settings to be independent on these objects, so adjust the scene
    object to optionally allow specifying a pointer to another object's
    settings to allow for simple sharing.
    
    We also need to let the drawing routines know to rebuild their dlists if
    the settings change (since normally they're rebuilt only when the data
    needs to adjust to something like a new LoD view.)  Add a bu_obj_stale
    function to handle the bookkeeping.

    Checkpoint test of a different selection approach
    
    Experimenting with a large comb tree suggests that Qt's QTreeView
    scrolling performance drops off when a large number of rows are
    selected.  See if we can use the mechanism we already have in place for
    highlighting drawing to do our own "selection" which doesn't use the Qt
    mechanism.  Preliminary testing suggests this will be more performant,
    so stashing the current state.

    Disable first object only select for rect - doesn't really make much sense.  If we eventually add a mode where we shoot a grid of rays within the rect, as opposed to just a bbox selection, it might make more sense, but right now the results will be fairly unintuitive.  This is mainly useful when you want to select a whole lot of objects simultaneously.

    Whee.  selectionChanged is connected to ged_deselect, and was getting triggered even when we were in the middle of a sync.  This was mutating the selection set while in the process of trying to sync the tree to reflect the current selection set.  Hilarity ensued.  Once it was clear what was happing, fix is simple - check for the sync flag before proceeding with the deselect logic.

    Add a notion of a current ged selection set.  In principle, this will allow the GUI to define and then switch to using different sets by updating the 'current' ged set, rather than hard coding 'default' as the working set.

    gcc thinks it sees a path through the logic where we can end up decrementing name to before cmdname buffer.  if true, that means we'd be writing nul a byte out of range.  this change adds the buffer len and keeps track where we're at.

    When we have GED syncing in the mix, we need to deselect (and remove from the GED set) top level paths (if any are selected) before trying to remove lower level paths.  If we go the other way, the remove of a lower level path with a higher level one active will activate all the other children of the lower level path ('preserving' the activity of the higher level path), which is not the behavior we want here

    Hmm. Qt6 is getting a mouseMoveEvent in the GL widget, even if the left mouse button isn't pressed.  This seems reasonable enough, but it's not how Qt5 behaved, therefore the enabled view manipulation mode always runs in Qt6, even if the left mouse button isn't pressed.  Correct this by adding a check to make sure we have a button press before proceeding.

    loudly protest that musl captures our librt references at runtime as erroneous behavior
    
    and provide an automatic workaround.  nobody should rely on this workaround, and it's not portable (assumes x86_64).  a better test would be to run the /lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 dynamic linker and see if it still exhibits the capture behavior, or to specify LD_PRELOAD as environment on the tools that must run during compilation.

    Use the selection model to restrict selections
    
    For .g tree widget purposes, we don't want to simultaneously have
    selected a child and a parent along the same tree path - conceptually,
    it is difficult to know what that implies for operations like editing
    and drawing (if tire.r and rim.c are both selected, do we only want
    tire.r?  Or only tire.r/rim.c? - in that case, if tire.r is selected,
    rim.c should be cleared.  Conversely, if tire.r/rim.c is selected, the
    parent tire.r selection is cleared so we can focus on rim.c)
    
    However, we DO allow multiple selections so long as each selection is on
    its own independent db_fullpath in the tree - one selection per path.
    So while a parent comb may have multiple children selected
    simultaneously, if the parent comb is selected all of the child
    selections are cleared, since the parent comb is in all of those paths.
    
    We still need to get this syncing with the GED sets, but that will
    require a slight modification to what we prototyped earlier for those
    sets.  We don't want to automatically collapse the selected paths to
    their most compact form - if we have a comb instance T/C with children
    1, 2 and 3 and we select T/C/1 T/C/2 and T/C/3, the implication is we
    want to edit those three instance matrices rather than the T/C instance
    matrix.  However, since the 1,2,3 selections would constitute a full
    selection of all of C's children, the collapse operation in GED would
    shrink the path to T/C.

    Embedding a checkbox is looking like it will be more trouble than it's

    visibility indications and background colors for selection status.

    Checkpoint experiment with checkbox drawing
    
    Since we want to use the highlighting colors to indicate selection
    states, probably want to see if we can use checkboxes to indicate
    whether items are drawn or not.
    
    This is probably going to be tricky - we use a custom painter to get
    full control of the item drawing, so if we want the mouse click on
    top of the widget to set the check box and not toggle the selection
    state, there'll probably be some gnarly event handling to do...

    Prove we can call the select method on the custom selection model

    No op thus far, but create and set selection model

    Start setting up for a custom QItemSelectionModel
    
    Trying to work with GED selection sets and the tree view, I'm thinking
    more and more that the original intent of the QgSelectionProxyModel
    would be better served by the item selection model.  I'm having
    difficulty trying to sync the selections with GED, which suggests I'm
    trying to do so at the wrong point in the Qt logic flows.
    
    As a preliminary stage, move everything not directly related to the tree
    view item highlighting down to QgModel (this doesn't involve any
    knowledge of tree view types in QgModel, so we're good there.)  The next
    stages will be more involved, since we'll need to change a fair bit of
    qged logic to remove the proxy model in favor of QgModel.  The state
    management for the edit modes vs. view modes highlighting will also have
    to be significantly reworked to function in its new location.  Expect
    some disruptions as this proceeds.
    
    End state goal is to have the tree view mode highlighting accurately
    reflect the GED selected paths state arrived at by set additions and
    removals (and ultimately update the displayed Qt tree selections in
    response to the GED select command on the command line, although that'll
    be another level of challenge.)  Once all that is in sync, we can return
    to the primitive editing question, since we'll have proper selection
    sets on which to operate.  For single selections this was never a
    challenge, but it is eminently plausible that users will want to select
    and (say) move multiple instances of multiple combs simultaneously, and
    we don't want our infrastructure to come up short due to design
    defects...

    At a guess, we need to handle custom selection via GED sets elsewhere.

    unknown portability and just a short-term fix.  still needs to become a proper flag test as this is probably no bueno on windows.
    code is also not good if it's ending up with input data on the stack.  it should be reworked dynamic as this is otherwise problematic for other reasons too (e.g., security).

    Get GED default selection set updating in response to QGED tree selections, but that immediately exposes a problem with multiple selections - the highlighting will need to be 'smart' with respect to what's actually active in a .g tree (for example, if we deselect all children, the parent shouldn't remain selected.)

    compiler noticed when setmode() wasn't used and issued warnings, so make sure to use it.
    
    worked on linux, but this approach still may be problematic on other compilers.  if it is, there are still other things we can do that are more of a burden, so trying this first.

    define an empty setmode() stub.
    
    quelling a windows warning exposed a limitation of #defining setmode() away.  it resulted in a stray (void) cast syntax error, so we instead provide a no-op function instead.  may need another approach if this isn't robust as system setmode() is being masked and we're relying on the compiler to resolve this properly as a static.

    ditto obj-g, need to promote the container to double now that wfobj parser uses doubles

Date:   Mon Jul 11 01:34:37 2022 -0400

    fix gcv on other platforms... conversion to double requires more support.
    
    in order to maintain the higher precision, the data containers need to also be upgraded.  mac and linux were failing rightly so on the implicit down-conversion.  of course, if we bump the parser, we have to also bump the plugin.

    replace _BU_ATTR_ANALYZER_NORETURN with FAUX_NORETURN.
    
    however, it is redundant and misleading when combined with NORETURN, so remove from current instances.  need to audit if there are other commands that do return but could be annotated as simulating no-return.

Author: Christopher Sean Morrison <brlcad@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 10 12:50:02 2022 -0400

    Introduce NORETURN as a new function annotation.
    
    Similar to DEPRECATED, this utilizes config testing, but does not require it as the fallback condition is a no-op.  This label marks a function that nominally doesn't return under normal behavior (e.g., exceptions, jumps, and such notwithstanding).  This helps with warnings generated by compilers and code anlaysis by static analyzers.

Author: Christopher Sean Morrison <brlcad@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 10 12:38:55 2022 -0400

    visual studio requires __declspec and other annotations precede the function to be valid syntax, so move most tests to the beginning.
    
    also add new tests for deprecated, which was being assumed.   this consequently also fixes __forceinline too.  moving compiler attributes to the front not only makes the tests pass where available better but sets the stage for making all the annotations become common features that can be used anywhere.

    Add noreturn annotations for msvc.
    
    Annoyingly, this requires moving the attribute to the front of declarations because __declspec(noreturn) is only syntactically valid at the front.  Does address about 100+ warnings, though.  Also fixed naming inconsistency with ANALYZER vs ANALYZE in clang's no-return attribute.

    Add __declspec(noreturn) and __forceinline checks.
    
    There's a slew of warnings that cannot be addressed without marking bu_exit and friends as being no-return functions.  Similarly, msvc has its own inlining keyword.

    that's a reduction from 1330 (which was an arbitrary bump up from 133) to one that's closer to the old 256 path limit.  quells warning about exceeding default stack size as an oburst struct has a couple dozen inlined and sits on the stack.

    There's no memory access here (CID 1506862)
    
    If I'm not mistaken, this is just a numerical value check without any
    intent to access memory at p+32.  Try some unsigned int casting for the
    arithmetic to see if we can avoid the appearance of calculating an
    invalid memory offset.

    Add path detection based on libbu location
    
    Up until now we've been using the executable runtime path to deduce the
    BRL-CAD root path, but that only works for our own executables.  If an
    external program in a different location needs this location, its
    executable path will be incorrect.
    
    When the whereami code supports it, prefer constructing the root path
    based on libbu's location.  We'll still fall back on trying the
    executable if that should fail, but when using libbu's location works it
    will be viable even for non-BRL-CAD programs.

    remove GED_ prefix on command-specific symbols.
    
    GED_ prefix is reserved for public symbols for readability.  It makes it much easier to know at a glance which symbols are API and which are implementation detail.  Convention for internal symbols and implemetation detail is to prefix using command name, here FACETIZE_ as prefix instead.

    _bu_prefix is intended only for internal implemetation functions that must be exported for some reason.  design pattern convention is to use a prefix that matches the API grouping (here 'mem' group) while keeping them static implementation detail.

    address some bu_mem() design issues
    
    very little (if any) other libbu api has return codes passed as
    parameters.  instead design the api to both returning an error code
    and/or the requested size type as is done with read()/write().
    currently also retains passing a parameter to be set, but might make
    sense to drop it.
    
    also notably using size_t and ssize_t since those types make more
    sense designwise as well.  they're defined as types capable of
    representing memory sizes, so they're rather appropriate for a
    function that obtains memory sizes.

    This reverts commit 6eb58567c0e61dea5ee2fb0ec54485d423057ea2.
    
    This was no bueno as CPP_STR stringifies BU_DIR_SEPARATOR.  It needed
    to be CPP_XSTR() but then still ends up as "'\'" which isn't helpful.
    Will instead deal with the potential overflow a different way.

    option handler shouldn't be printing to anything.
    
    doing so assumes calling app can even display to std out/err or wants to have that happen.  instead, pull that validation, remapping, and printing logic back into app front-end where it's entirely appropriate to output as it establishes the output context.
    
    logic was changed so that enabling any debug (bu's, librt's or liboptiocal's) will let the app utilize a #cpu specification greater than what would otherwise be allowed.

    it was implemented in support of the 2001 linux kernel (2.4) which had a bug affecting thread accounting.  this workaround spawned all threads in a subprocess, whose accounting did not have the bug so rt statistics could be calculated accurately.  support for the 2.4 kernel ended in 2011, so plenty of time to let the hack go.  if it's still needed, it may make more sense to have libbu simply do its own time accounting.

    eliminate the compile-time variance and restore MPI.
    
    Introducing RT_TXT_OUTPUT consequently commented out important MPI calls and introduced code and build complexity in order to avoid libdm linkage.  restoring to keep it simpler.  It also created secondary runtime behavior that we don't test (hence MPI), but really for simplicity, easier understanding.
    
    Revert "Add backend dependencies for rt targets, but in the process limit the libdm linkage to those commands that might display graphically."
    
    This reverts commit 0c61982e31da09a9a46d381e768d4007d9eb6967.

    looks like starseeker probably fixed rtweight infinite loop.
    
    rtweight was changed over to libanalyze for .density file parsing back in 2019, so attributing the change to a prior release.  also looks like it no longer reports infinite volumes also when file is empty, but does report nan centroids if density is 0.

    per user request, make -Ae exposed air NOT include gapped air.
    
    instead, now only reports air exposed at the beginning or end of shotlines.  this undoes the change introduced in 00e3074fa8fcc8142a4849001dd2486a3721c2fe which included gapped air reporting but considering it minimally impacting due to the fact that gapped air is still reported via -Ag as a workaround (note -Ag reports all geometry gaps) until we figure out with users if there needs to be a separate Analysis mode specifically for gapped air.

    The previous commit is not going to work. Object full paths need to be preserved when checking to ensure hierarcial information is maintainted.
    
    Major change to find_cmd_line_obj so that now the full path is compared by split along slashes instead of only checking the parent. Also changed the return type to be the object pointer instead of an int for the index for a more intuitive return.
    Added error checking and a log cap to make the issue apparent but reduce memory use and unnecessary blather.

    Merge pull request #47 from f4alt/nirt
    
    Nirt options cleanup when run within mged.  This makes it so -h -L and -f all work on nirt when run from within mged.  Plot wireframe behavior wasn't tested.  Mged prints in triplicate, but appears to be a side effect of echoing stdout and returning it as a result string (should maybe return empty) and echoing the result string.

    add ideas regarding slash management from user feedback
    
    currently, it's easy to write out an object with slashest in the name that then cause subsequent issues in some commands.  this is usually a result of copy-pasting decorated tops/ls output, so may make sense to change that default ala system ls command's -p option.

    For menu action on tree items, we want the new comb instance aware fullpath strings.  Proof out a way to get them from the QgItem data

commit 7d396a185d9dc8111229e132893c68469d774a92

    Merge branch 'instance_spec' into main
    
    This logic implements a way to specify specific comb instances to
    command line commands.  For example, the tree:
    
    comb
      u [M1] obj
      u [M2] obj
      u [M3] obj
    
    traditionally has been difficult for commands to deal with - if the user
    wishes to (say) draw or erase only the comb/[M2]obj instance from a
    scene, there hasn't been a good way to do it.
    
    These changes add support for a "@#" syntax to reference individual
    instances.  In the above example, the particular instances of obj would
    be addressed as follows:
    
    comb/[M1]obj -> comb/obj or comb/obj@0
    comb/[M2]obj -> comb/obj@1
    comb/[M3]obj -> comb/obj@2
    
    For the time being, this feature is off by default - this syntax means
    that full path -> string translations will no longer result in path
    strings whose sub-strings consist solely of valid object names, and
    logic that expects this (i.e is not aware of the @# suffixes and how to
    deal with them) will break.  It is being integrated in disabled form to
    avoid getting out of sync with the main tree - the changes are somewhat
    complex in the code, and would make for a difficult merge if main
    underwent any significant alterations.
    
    For applications to enable the behavior, they can set the
    LIBRT_USE_COMB_INSTANCE_SPECIFIERS environment variable:
    
    bu_setenv("LIBRT_USE_COMB_INSTANCE_SPECIFIERS", "1", 1);
    
    Right now, only the experimental qged interface exposes this behavior.
    It has been tested with the new draw and erase implementations, and rt
    is able to raytrace scene descriptions passed by ert that are generated
    by erasing instances from the scene.  This feature will be needed when
    we enable draw and erase menu items for the tree widget, whose entries
    represent individual unique instances.  There are also implications for
    the GED edit command that haven't been explored yet - they will be
    considered when we look at the edit command and its integration with
    qged.

    Test adding a behavior flag to the db_i struct
    
    Since the comb instance path support is disruptive, we need a way to
    enable/disable it (at least in the early stages) so we don't break
    existing logic.  dbip is present when we are setting up db_full_path
    structures, so that is where we need to add a setting if we aren't going
    to otherwise change the API.  As long as the fp_cinst array is zero
    (i.e. its default) the strings generated for full paths will be the
    standard strings of current behavior, and if we can key the setting of
    fp_cinst based on this value being 1, we should be able to allow qged to
    enable this behavior while leaving it off for everyone else by default.

    If subtraction paths get specified, we don't want them showing up in the image - e.g. "./bin/rt matrix_tests.g sphs/comb_sph1 /sphs/comb_sph1@2" - comb_sph1@2 is subtracted from sphs and so shouldn't make a positive contributeion to the image.  Not entirely sure if this is the correct place to do this check - feels like we should be catching it earlier - but checkpoint it since it seems to work.  Note that this probably isn't what we want for pick mode, so probably needs more thought.

    Checkpoint work on hierarchy instance specification
    
    Got as far as draw and erase in qged being able to draw and erase
    specific comb instances using the "@#" notation for paths.
    
    However, ert (embedded raytracing) does not work, because the raytracing
    layer doesn't correctly process the new path syntax.  libged can pass
    the paths to rt, but rt won't know what to do with them.  Adding support
    for the new syntax will involve some scary changes to the core of the
    librt tree walking layers, so it's time for a branch.
    
    This is painful, but appears to be necessary for proper support of a
    number of graphical interface features.  It first came up when using the
    erase mouse tool to clear objects out of a scene - reported paths in
    "who" weren't unique after such erasures, highlighting the lack of a way
    to address specific instances on the command line.  Such interaction
    modes make it more likely we'll need to raytrace otherwise atypical
    lists of instances, which will eventually result in an incorrect visual
    as the user erases one instance and rt interprets the specifier as a
    different instance.  Another, more readily observable problem is what
    happens if we want to add support to the tree widget for selecting and
    drawing specific instances in the tree - the tree exposes all instances,
    but to visualize them we need to pass a unique string specifier to the
    draw command, and we don't (or didn't, at any rate) have a way to do so.
    And even if we were to add some convoluted hack specific to the tree to
    try and work around this, we'd still have the ert problem.
    
    Once it is clear what logic changes are needed for this to work
    correctly, we can decide how to introduce it back into main.  There's a
    decent chance we can't use the environment variable guards used for the
    GED commands for speed reasons, so we may have to introduce a new
    function stack with the intent of it eventually replacing the current
    logic once it proves out.  For testing purposes in the branch we'll make
    the changes in-situ to avoid unnecessary complications, but it would
    almost certainly be too risky to merge the changes in that form.

    This is primarily done by loading the nirt_debug flag '-X' with 'ged' before sending the command directly to nirt so we output the correct usage within mged context without duplicating commands.
    
    Began support for -f fmt within mged
    Option is now recognized and printed to user, however line duplication and formatting needs to be resolved.

    Adjust hash calculation to produce an op/mat agnostic icnt value

    Not using hash mode - remove.
    
    Coming up against a long standing problem - commands like draw and erase
    don't have a good way to specify specific instances of comb trees.  For
    example, if we have:
    
    a
      u [M1] b
      u [M2] b
      - [M3] b
    
    and we want to draw or erase just the M2 instance of a/b, we don't have
    a way to specify it.  This is a problem when operating the graphical
    erase plugin on scene object paths, since the scene objects correspond
    to specific a/b style instances but we don't have any way to translate
    those concepts into individual GED command manipulations.  (Nor is the
    problem unique to that case - it is just the most current example.)  The
    bookkeeping needed for drawing contraindicates trying to evolve some
    sort of special case manipulation for this particular situation - we
    need a way for GED commands (and librt prep, for that matter) to
    individually specify specific comb tree instances.  The same problem
    arises when we think about defining custom sets of instances based on
    selections from the scene.

    Start thinking about object set selection.
    
    For editing, view drawing object changes with graphical selection, etc.
    we want to hone in on the concept of "working sets" of objects.  We
    don't have sed/oed, but we do have to have some sense of which object or
    objects in the who set we intend to apply edit operations to.  We also
    want Archer's ability to graphically identify objects to erase from the
    current drawn set, and probably other abilities as well.

    Reconnect the fb_mode toggle
    
    This button exposes a weakness in the current signal/slot design for
    view management - the button will toggle the view, but does not update
    the view settings plugin.  This is a side effect of needing to avoid
    triggering an event which will force GUI updates if the gui is itself
    the origin of the action to initiate change, which has potential for
    infinite looping, but in this case also results in one GUI element not
    correctly reflecting a view state change as a consequence of action by
    another GUI widget.  We also must bear in mind that both elements may
    need updating as a consequence of view state changes driven by a command
    line command.
    
    Need to take a step back and consider what changes are needed.

    merge system path searching from bu_whereis into bu_which
    
    while they are different with bu_whereis specifically searching system paths and bu_which only looking in the user's PATH, that's not a helpful distinction when we're looking for programs.  moreover, our whereis behavior wasn't strictly conforming as system whereis also reports back all matching results and we only returned the first.  so this change has it look in both user and system locations until it finds the command in question.  probably should rename as behavior is no longer posix-striving.

    Either the behavior of file() is not consistent across versions of cmake when splitting across lines, or the behavior of cmakelists() is inconsistent in how it deals with mergeing lists with spaces.  This change checks the prior to see which is problematic in order to understand where the limitation resides.

    Otherwise, it'll fail to find Itcl during package require when we're compiling against a system 8.5 tcl/tk.  Setting it to 8.5 makes it work on 8.5, 8.6, and should work on future versions.

    consistent grid spacing
    
    - always use gridSpacing as grid spacing value
    - shifted the grid a bit more to the middle by starting the first ray at
    "min + gridSpacing / 2" instead of "min + gridSpacing"
    - the rays are generated from 1 to state.steps - 1, i.e. the number of
    steps is in fact state.steps - 1, which should be state.span /
    gridSpacing, on the other hand

    This script calculates visibility for specified eye points at given base object(s) with optional occluder(s).  It autogenerates a stack of images, labels, and more into an annotated top-down and perspective view rendering for those eye points with exceptional analytic effect.  this script really could be turned into a full-fledged generally-useful application, but was rapidly prototyped for a real use case.  it's included here in a raw state to preserve it.

    As with transparency, make the internal lighting value the only/canonical value so we don't have to be concerned about syncing issues.

Date:   Mon May 9 17:48:05 2022 -0400

    Consolidate the transparency variables
    
    Rather confusingly, the opengl display managers (the only ones that
    currently support transparency) use both an internal variable and an
    entry in the dm calltable to track and report transparency.
    
    This change consolidates to use the internal variable, with a
    getTransparency function replacing the dm_transparency variable.  Any
    backend that implements a transparency setting can define it the same way
    the OpenGL backends define their mvars settings.
    
    Longer term we may also want to replace all the variable specific
    function pointers with some variation on _dm_cmd_get so we don't
    have to keep changing the calltable every time a backend wants to expose
    a new setting...

    match rt's perspective mode rendering even better.
    
    perspective rendering was a half viewsize off and it's not yet exactly clear to me why, but this makes it match exactly for at least standard az/el view descriptions.  suspect there's a factor inside rt's perspective mode view setup (that probably shouldn't be there).  regardless, we reinstate the viewsize*0.5 so orthogonal and perspective can both call do_ae() as-is.  no hints looking back through time on why the 0.5 is in there.

    this gets art working with the perspective camera too!
    
    finally figured out the discrepancy.  rt computes a view-rot-scale
    matrix in order to calculate the eye and view2model view matrix.
    appleseed however needs a view-rot matrix as it calculates the scale
    based on camera parameters.  result was the view not matching because
    of a double application of viewsize (which in a perspective view
    results in massive zooming).
    
    this recalculates the view2model matrix without viewsize incorporated
    and it works like a charm.

    Print the prefix if a deep path is given to search
    
    When search is given a deep path (for example, /all.g/box.r) it will do
    the search using box.r as the starting point.  Previously, this meant
    that the results would be printed using box.r as the root:
    
    /box.r
    /box.r/box.s
    
    This may be surprising when the full path is supplied, particularly if
    the caller wants the results to be relative to the full specified path.
    The adjustment here keeps the prefix when reporting the search results:
    
    /all.g/box.r
    /all.g/box.r/box.s
    
    Note that under the hood the search is still conducted relative to
    box.r.  In particular, a -depth 1 option will start counting from box.r,
    not all.g - this is a bit unintuitive, but a fix will require somewhat
    deeper changes to the search logic to recognize the initial depth of the
    supplied path and process accordingly.

    Allow separate toggling of mesh and csg LoD
    
    Since we're usually wanting mesh LoD to decrease drawn information and
    CSG LoD to increase it, we may want to enable/disable them separately
    depending on whether we're trying for better visuals or to reduce memory
    footprint.  "view lod" will still control them in sync, but allow for
    individual toggling as well.

    Various adjustments to drawing LoD test.
    
    Behaving somewhat better now - still not an enormous speed-up, but looks
    like maybe a bit of an improvement, and if we ever switch to more modern
    APIs we might be able to do better.  More importantly, this approach
    offers the possibility of reclaiming transient large memory usages.
    
    Fundamentally, the CSG LoD was intended to increase drawing detail
    rather than decreasing it, and its settings are configured
    accordingly.

    Move the definition of a torus to libbg
    
    Wanting to do some experiments with polyline LoD plotting using torus as
    a test subject.  There's nothing inherently specific to librt about the
    structure itself, so move it down to libbg to make the concept of a
    geometric torus available at that level.
    
    This shouldn't have any implications for librt, as from its perspective
    this is just a structure/magic name change (s expressions have been
    added to CHANGES file.)

    Get libbg LoD out of the draw triggering business
    
    Having adjusted so the scene object is what's being passed, we can just
    call a generic object drawing operation and let the backend function
    figure out what specifically to do.
    
    In addition to being cleaner generally, this is specifically intended as
    a step towards using dm_draw_obj to kick off wireframe specific LoD
    routines the same way we're triggering logic for mesh cases.

    Make gl_draw_tri into a generic bv_scene_obj call.
    
    The mesh LoD data is only one of a number of possible specific types we
    may want to handle - rather than tie up a callback slot with each
    specific type, just pass the scene obj through and use the type flags
    "under the hood" to figure out which specific drawing routines to use
    for specific scene objects.
    
    This should allow for more flexibility and much less code changing as we
    experiment with different ways to draw scene objects.

    Merge pull request #32 from LouisTheLeaf/destringify
    
    ART Bottlenecking Fixes.  This eliminates the string comparison (performance boost) that was left over from the fall effort.  It creates one RTIP per region and efficiently uses the original dirbuild that was performed for autosizing.   This likely inadvertently fixes an issue with overlap geometry not getting the right shader info too since there will no longer be overlaps possible via librt (instead appleseed will do whatever it does to resolve them).

    I had originally removed the completion support from the Paraview

    we're getting to the point where tab completion is a question, we're

    Stubbing in the methods and calls - untested, as we'll need a fair bit
    of machinery in place before we can kick these particular tires...

    First stab at constructing the frustum
    
    Still working through how to construct what we need for intersection
    testing.  By default, it looks like the eye point is inside the scene,
    which means the near plan is also in the scene and the frustum doesn't
    actually bound what's drawn.  We might want near distance == 0 to get
    the full pyramid, but need to check if the SAT test will tolerate that.

    Note some problems with CSG LoD that need work
    
    With the LMDB refinement, triangle LoD is now working reasonably well in
    a couple of tests.  The next obvious problem is in mixed bot/csg models
    where rotating around is growing memory alarmingly.
    
    This commit fixes an obvious problem that was triggering a redraw on
    every view change regardless of whether it was needed, but it doesn't
    address the underlying issues that this mistake exposed.  The reuse of
    vlists, which is a staple of vlist drawing for performance, doesn't
    scale when we start doing lots of very high detail vlists for many many
    zoomed in solids.  We need to do view culling the way we do for BoTs to
    limit hyper zooming to only visible primitives, and look at how we're
    handling vlist management for these wireframes in LoD mode.
    
    If we have to we can allow the user to enable/disable LoD for bots and
    csg selectively, but they really shouldn't have to do that in the first
    place.  I don't want to complicate the usability unless it proves much
    more difficult than I expect to make the necessary improvements to CSG
    handling so everything can Just Work...

    Stash a test of double to/from long int conversion
    
    When "snapping" vertices from double or float to integer types for
    robustness, we want (in principle) as little information loss as we can
    manage.  This test is experimenting with how to determine what those
    limits are dynamically based on input information.
    
    Did this as part of some early LoD experiments - ended up going another
    direction for that work, but this idea may still be needed/useful down
    the road so stash it for reference.

    Was hitting an error in damlevlim.cpp on Windows having to do with
    assert failures.  It turns out that when this file was adapted from the
    C++17 upstream version, I missed a C++14 requirement implicit in the
    std::mismatch function.  There IS an older version of that function, but
    it is unsafe when the second string is shorter (which of course happens
    frequently with this function.)  Rather irritatingly, Linux apparently
    compiles and runs this fine even with the C++11 flags set, so it was
    only when the Windows runtime failure triggered that it was caught.
    
    This function can be re-implemented using something like vls, but since
    we're going to need C++14 at some point for the more modern openNURBS
    anyway, go ahead and bump the standard now rather than doing an
    ephemeral rework.

    First cut at visibility-based LoD updates
    
    When we zoom in on a large model, there's no need to update data for
    objects we're not going to see.  Generate an oriented bounding box from
    the view info and use the SAT test to identify which objects need to
    have their LoD adjusted.
    
    This just leaves the previous levels as-is - may be worth experimenting
    with reducing the memory footprint of non-visible objects and/or
    skipping the drawing operation for objects we can flag as not visible.

    Apply the matrix at draw time, not in initial load
    
    Rather than loading the mesh data with the matrix applied, cache it once
    and apply the matrix from the scene object's information at draw time.
    
    This saves on cache calculations for models using matrices, While in
    principle this would allow us to store one lod structure per unique mesh
    and reuse that for multiple scene objects, that is only viable in
    orthogonal drawing - in perspective mode, we will most likely want to
    load different LoD levels in different instances of the same object as a
    function of distance from the camera, which would make such reuse
    untenable.
    
    For xpushed models this approach doesn't buy us anything even in
    orthogonal mode since we don't have non-unique meshes anyway, but on
    models making heavy use of matrices to instance objects the processing
    and disk space savings are significant.
    
    Another benefit (and the reason this is being done now) is we can look
    up a stored cache key based on the directory pointer of the solid,
    without having to try and incorporate the matrix hash into the look-up.
    The latter would be somewhat unstable, since we calculate the matrix on
    the fly during tree walk.  Floating point fuzz would most likely result
    in the same walk not always producing exactly the same matrix, and thus
    not hashing to exactly the same value (npush has to cope with similar
    issues, but it retains the full matrix to do so.)  That would make
    reliable cache lookups iffy and shouldn't be needed in any case, if we
    can simply defer the matrix handling until the drawing stage.

    Need two-sided shading for LoD drawing
    
    When we have thin objects (like a windshield) or we get to very low
    levels of detail, the snapping can result in collapsed triangles - i.e.
    both sides of the solid drawing a triangle in the same place.  That
    means if we're providing normals, we can end up with the "wrong"
    triangle being the last one drawn for a given view, depending on the
    ordering.   At low detail levels this effect manifests as "speckling"
    and is a bit annoying, but it is extremely apparent on large thin
    solids. OpenGL has a lighting model for this situation, so we enable it
    to avoid jarring visual artifacts.

    Start setting up to figure out dlist support
    
    Using OpenGL Display Lists is desirable for drawing performance, but
    involves some tradeoffs when it comes to memory size (which is the
    reason the MGED gui makes it a user option rather than always enabling
    it.)  To generate a dlist we need to hold both the original triangle
    data and the OpenGL data in memory until the list generation process is
    complete.  At that point the drawing code can clear the original lod
    data (we'll need to add a function to support that), but for at least
    the duration of the generation process our memory requirements are 2X
    that of just directly drawing the triangles.
    
    This extra memory requirement has a number of implications.  Without
    splitting up large meshes, there are a category of meshes we simply
    won't be able t handle in memory at all.  This is always true as meshes
    get arbitrarily large, but the constraint gets tighter if we use dlists.
    We need to fall back on NOT using a dlist if the mesh LoD data looks
    like it is beyond a threshold size, to avoid the user having to manually
    enable/disable dlist usage - they shouldn't have to know anything about
    it.
    
    (Part of the LoD goal is to avoid trying to push that much data through
    the pipeline in the first place, but for the moment we may still face
    this scenario if the user zooms in close to a large mesh.  We would need
    the hierarchical breakdown of the mesh and selective loading to cope
    with that situation - we may get there, but don't have that capability
    yet - early tests were disabled until we get the initial capability
    working.)
    
    There will certainly be more implications, but one definite requirement
    will be that the loading code must recognize when data has been
    completely cleared to save memory and a full reload is required in
    situations that would otherwise involve only a partial load.  There is a
    tradeoff here, since a full load involves reading in all the lower level
    files that can otherwise be kept in memory (avoids file I/O overheads.)
    It may be that for sufficiently small in-memory footprints it would be
    worthwhile to keep the non-dlist data and pay the memory overhead, and
    only start purging when memory costs get high - this would save a lot of
    small file accesses for "zoomed out" items that only require small
    meshes.  Accordingly, the loading code will simply look at the current
    state of the points list to see if prior data is found in memory or not.
    
    We will need bu_mem to asssess the current memory state of the system
    and what our available resources are - the gl_draw_tri code will be the
    point at which we make the decision to create a dlist or proceed with
    the "normal" drawing, so we'll also need a way to report the memory size
    of the lod data in user code.

    Add an IDN matrix to the lod test
    
    This has no functional implications, but it is being added to help make
    it clarify that this is the point at which a hierarchy matrix is applied
    to the mesh data. (Its application here is why we don't need to concern
    ourselves subsequently with applying matrices to vertices.  It also
    means that we aren't able to apply any instancing tricks to use one mesh
    + matrices to reduce our memory footprint without some major design
    implications.  However, as far as I can tell the OpenGL versions that
    would allow us to do that are newer than our current minimum anyway...)

    Verify the level is correct at the draw point.
    
    Need to rethink how the LoD is being triggered generally - the CSG
    primitives are being handled by draw_update, but that's probably not the
    right way to do it - particularly since we won't know how many child
    levels we need to iterate.  May be better to have each object set a
    callback that knows what to do and is triggered at draw time, instead of
    trying to orchestrate at higher levels.

    this fixes the issue finding the boost libs during compile.
    
    apparently if we just let boost find libs, it ends up finding and using dynamic libs during cmake, but then attempts to link against static libs during linking (which are named differently -- with a lib prefix -- and thus not found).   we either have to specify static-only or dynamic-only to boost in order for the streams to not get crossed.  it works to manually add the boost lib dir to the msvc project after cmake generation, but that doesn't work for msvc 2022's ninja build and is annoying/confusing.  this avoids the issue altogether.

    some new vs2022 defaults to ignore
    
    msvc 2022 now has cmake support integrated so all you have to do is open our top-level source folder.   it autoscans, configures, and generates cmake on the fly (repeatedly as any cmake files change).  defaults to an out/build/x86-Debug build dir and similarly out/install/x64-Debug dir for the install path.  appears to be using ninja for building, is fully syntax aware, and integrated with intellisense and git.  kind of nifty actually.

    request all dynamic libs from boost.
    
    otherwise, msvc needs to have the boost dir manually added to the solution, or the static libs need to be manually set during cmake.

    some new vs2022 defaults to ignore
    
    msvc 2022 now has cmake support integrated so all you have to do is open our top-level source folder.   it autoscans, configures, and generates cmake on the fly (repeatedly as any cmake files change).  defaults to an out/build/x86-Debug build dir and similarly out/install/x64-Debug dir for the install path.  appears to be using ninja for building, is fully syntax aware, and integrated with intellisense and git.  kind of nifty actually.

    rt_clean_resource_complete() was invalidating the resource (setting magic to 0), which we don't want to do if it's the rt_uniresource since that's supposed to remain 'valid' for internal use at all times.  probably shouldn't invalidate at all, but the repercussions aren't known.

    First cut at making level-appropriate pnts
    
    Give a point, make a stab at putting it through the level transforms to
    truncate it to that level - in effect, 'snap' it to the level grid.
    Based on the visual output some version of this is probably the heart of
    the "decode" operation for POP buffers, but I've not yet dug in to
    confirm that - i.e., this may not be correct yet.  Also, need to do
    cumulative triangle writing, not individual levels - deeper levels
    assume the triangles of higher levels.

    wow, a bonefide Windows 10 CRT bug..  this fixes a Heap Error on Windows.
    
    if we print to stderr (unbuffered) without a newline and then call setvbuf() to set line buffering, there's a crash (rather, heap corruption detected) deep inside the windows kernel libs (ntdll, msvcrt, and related libs).  even if we skip the line buffering call, printing unbuffered without a newline appears to even still trigger corruption detection on exit.  fix here is to simply make sure we add the newline.  we set line buffering before doing anything else just for good measure.

    document the new material property infrastructure.
    
    this work is the culmination of a capston engineeering project from
    TAMU students Trey Dinges, Cole Connelly, Vincent Olivarez, Chris
    McGregor, Alex Studwell, and Reid Wilson.  they worked on implementing
    a new BRL-CAD database entity type for storing material properties (a
    'material' object), a new material command in libged, and updates to
    rtweight, gqa, and art to use the new material objects.
    
    does need to be reconciled with the other material property mechanisms
    (.density vs _DENSITIES vs material objects) and the 'mater' command
    itself, but material objects are the only way to pass advanced shaders
    to our new 'art' appleseed PBR renderer.  material objects can have
    different sets of material properties including physical, mechanical,
    optical, thermal.

    document the team of six at Texas A&M University, Fall 2021
    
    Trey, Chris, Cole, Alex, Vincent, and Reid worked a full semester on
    material property infrastructure under an engineering capstone program
    offered in their CS department, and in collaboration with AFC, DAC,
    NSIN, and TAMU.
    
    Highlights include a prototype gltf geometry importer, a new
    'material' command in mged, new material object support in .g files,
    materialx and osl shader support, and appleseed physically based
    rendering (aka 'art').  The art enhancements successfully brought
    together a demonstration years in the making, started in 2014 at gsoc
    10th anniversary summit with the appleseed project, notably fixing
    support for multiple object materials and fixing critical bounding box
    issues.
    
    The capstone team was judged by an industry panel at TAMU and won
    first place in the CS department for this effort (1200+ participants
    in the capstone program at TAMU).

    Eliminate the separate libged DM management
    
    Rather than trying to track the display manager pointers separately at
    the GED level, we will instead rely on the gvp->dmp pointers.  These can
    be updated by client codes without requiring them to know about GED, and
    as long as GED keeps track of the views it will also know how to find
    all the dmps.  The responsibility of code attaching a dmp to a view is
    thus to assign the struct dm pointer to the view's dmp slot, since the
    broader codebase won't know about the DM except through its view.

    Revert "Remove old burst code"
    
    This reverts commit d0e5cc6b2855e397e133ec299642b0e3fc72e01a.
    
    since burst's outputs are inputs to another tool outside our control,
    removing burst is not minimally impacting unless/until we demonstrate
    it produces the same output.  there's no unit tests demonstrating this
    yet.  there is a regression test, but it doesn't do a comparison.
    
    if output and behavior has been manually confirmed, then we should
    document what did change (via manpage updates and NEWS any changes)
    and name the new binary burst instead of nburst to avoid affecting
    downstream more than necessary.

    Use file structure to assign target folders
    
    Sean figured out that our using the "regress" directory for regression
    targets might be causing problems with Visual Studio.  Instead of using
    that as a catch-all, assign folders based on the file system directory
    in which the targets are defined.  This is largely what we were doing
    manually anyway, and also has the advantage of producing a target
    organization that lines up with the files on disk.

    turn eigen hunting off, just use what we bundle.
    
    header-only libs are not usually worth toggling.  an update to a
    system installed header-only lib is (by far) most likely to result in
    a compilation failure than it is a useful security or significant
    performance improvement.  security issues are already a priority
    for all bundled dependencies, significant performance is unlikely.
    
    from a build management perspective, this change will stop the
    excessive cmake blather from Third_Party_Headers() calling
    find_package() warning that Eigen does not exist as a package.  it was
    confusing to some compiling as it looked very much like an error.

    not finding 64bit or 32bit flags is not a critical failure
    
    default is going to be one or the other regardless, so we just need to know if there is a flag found that can be set.  encountered this error on a Mac Mini M1 where default is 64bit and no 64-bit flags are necessary (or valid).

    fix windows issue when sources got with git but built with wsl fail.
    
    issue is by default git for windows checks out text files with CRLF
    line endings.  this is a problem for awk which is expecting unix-style
    LF line endings.
    
    fix used here is to leverage cmake's ability to configure a file and
    perform eol conversions, so we copy the awk scripts from source to
    binary. this ensures they have LF endings and build logic is updated
    to use the build dir version.
    
    as before, we're intentionally avoiding .gitattributes to avoid going
    down that road if we don't have to.  will attempt to submit this
    upstream.

commit 4ee6e7f8443efb354198935fd7a521977429e8a6

    fixed an issue with excessive memory use by mged and fb-friends.
    
    the maximum image size is a hard-coded limit for most framebuffer
    implementations and it was bumped up a long time ago to 20480x20480 in
    order to support large rendering.  however, this resulted in 1.6GB
    memory use per framebuffer which, at the time was thought to be the
    usage limit.  turns out mged allocates at least two plus one for each
    rt window, which can quickly exhausting available memory on lower-end
    systems or simply launching mged multiple times. prior to this change,
    simply launching mged once resulted in over 5GB memory utilization.
    
    in order to reinstate usability on systems with <4GB memory, this
    change bumps the maximum image size down to 8192x8192.  that results
    in 256MB per fb and mged+rt launching in under <1GB.
    
    another unintended result: application launch is now noticeably
    faster.  mged having to allocate and initialize 5GB on launch may be
    related to startup application stalls observed, as they could be
    explained by the VMM having to occasionally swap out on first
    invocation.
    
    work is needed to eliminate this hard-coded limit.  framebuffers and
    display managers should only dynamically allocate memory that is
    actually needed based on specified use.

    Correct db_lookup logic for name with '/' char
    
    Back in 2018, when I added SVN commit r71281 I asserted that it wasn't
    valid to have the forward slash '/' in an object name, and consequently
    its presence indicated we have a path.  Unfortunately, while that
    probably *should* be true, it turns out there exist examples in the wild
    that do define their names with forward slashes.  It is possible to
    create an example of this in MGED with: make "test.s/" sph
    
    Accordingly, adjust db_lookup to first try a normal lookup on the
    provided string without doing anything path related.  If that doesn't
    work, we can then go ahead and try and interpret the supplied string as
    a path, but if we don't first try the literal string we simply can't get
    the correct directory pointer to manipulate in the "test.s/" case.
    
    The presence of such a name does probably indicate either a mistake or
    some sort of automated conversion naming, but regardless of how it got
    there we have to be able to work with it to fix it.  Since it *can*
    exist, correct the librt logic accordingly.

    Don't make fast4-g region names for skipped bots
    
    Customer report of spurious high level groups in fast4-g conversions
    using the -c option to constrain the conversion to a particular subset
    of the model.  One of the make_region_name calls was getting triggered
    even when the region_id was in a skipped range, which was artificially
    increasing the maximum active region_id and resulting in empty region
    combs being activated for higher level component numbers.
    
    Fix is to guard the bot make_region_name call with a skip_region check.

    fix a null-pointer-subtraction warning/error being issued on qsort.
    
    Turns out the OpenBSD implementaiton we're using has optimizations for
    sorting by different byte alignments (int and long in addition to
    char) and the method employed for determining alignment relied on
    offsetting the pointer address from address zero in order to modulo
    the element size.  This can cause particular havoc with link time
    optimization (LTO) and other strategies that assume strict aliasing.
    
    These optimizations are very similar to other optimized qsort
    implementations and came up in a lengthy discussion in the SPEC
    benchmark (which has a qsort test based on BSD and lots of other tests
    that use that qsort implementation).  Their "fix" was to degrade
    everything to char swaps (i.e., eliminate the optimization) which SPEC
    rejected on simple principle of the benchmark already being published,
    but to my eye it would have negatively affected the benchmark anyways,
    so good call...
    
    A better fix I think is the one proposed here where we keep the
    optimization, and simply rely on casting the pointer through to a
    uintptr_t instead of subtracting null.  Since we're solely dealing
    with long/int/char alignments, it should be a safe enough assumption
    (at least insofar as being as reliable as subtracting null) and a fix
    that will keep LTO optimization happy.
    
    Original error was:
    
    error: performing pointer subtraction with a null pointer has undefined behavior [-Werror,-Wnull-pointer-subtraction]
    
    While a different qsort variant, relevant summary at:

    rework dynamic library closing, now deferred to avoid racing.
    
    closing dynamically opened libraries on demand was causing a problem
    (segfault) on Mac due to our use of C++ constructors/destructors to
    load and unload plugins.  when dynamically loading a library that
    causes its dependencies to also be dynamically loaded (e.g., loading
    libged-dm loads libdm which loads all the dm plugins), there was a
    problem when the libraries were closed.  libraries (libdm in this
    case) were being unloaded while we were still in that library's
    destructor. the plugin that caused that library to be loaded,
    libged-dm, was already unloaded so it would crash while still in the
    destructor in the process of unloading that library's plugins.
    
    the solution employed here is to defer closing so that the constructor
    can complete, and introduce an explicit purge function bu_dlunload()
    that actually unloads all the libraries.  this only happens when libbu
    is unloaded (again using the destructor method), or bu_dlunload() can
    be manually called to force it.

    undo antipattern of checking for null before calling free.
    
    this was done just to avoid bu_free() blathering about NULL, intended to catch bad book-keeping, but was more typically just if-checked as the pointer being released often came from a different context.  now that bu_free() handles NULL silently like stdlib, these checks can be removed.  care is just needed to keep post-santify logic intact that sets NULL after free.

    remove temp debugging logic
    
    introduced a new environment variable and encountered a maintenance cost.  also,
    shouldn't be needed as a breakpoint can be set on the error statement instead of
    adding a manual pause.  alternatively, we could dump a stacktrace (with or without
    bombing) to catch them or do what libc does and simply ignore them if they are no
    longer useful to us.

    tests.  UUID code really doesn't get along with C++, so give it its own
    executable.

    Fix the Bullet based simulate command build

    clear out stale nirt issues.
    
    the issue with changing units is a deep and not likely to get fixed anytime soon.
    was unable to reproduce the nirt -e parsing issue inside/outside mged. perhaps
    it's platform specific.  the sf bug report need not be replicated here, and that
    issue hasn't been observed.  uninstalled behavior is a nicety, but not necessary.

    limit large memory allocation to prevent maliciousness
    
    CID 1489217 found tainted allocations.  since pkg sizes are
    potentially very large (e.g., sending a large file as a single
    package), we do want to allow large sizes, but still need to impose
    some upper limit.  using the max size of ssize_t (i.e., max int) minus
    the two bytes being added during malloc() since that's nominally what
    a valid caller might maximally send.

    address slew of new type mismatches gcc 11 detects
    
    lastest gcc is much better at tracking typedef types and noticing
    when functions are declared with one type and defined with other
    type-compatible parameters.
    
    used to be a problem long ago with some compilers not working well
    with typedef types as parameters (e.g., vect_t vs fastf_t *) but
    this forunately/hopefully is a vestige.  updates tested on linux
    and mac, so hopefully windows behaves.

    which both expect 3D vectors.  fix employed is to simply pack them into a 3D

    fix a null-pointer-subtraction warning/error being issued on qsort.
    
    Turns out the OpenBSD implementaiton we're using has optimizations for
    sorting by different byte alignments (int and long in addition to
    char) and the method employed for determining alignment relied on
    offsetting the pointer address from address zero in order to modulo
    the element size.  This can cause particular havoc with link time
    optimization (LTO) and other strategies that assume strict aliasing.
    
    These optimizations are very similar to other optimized qsort
    implementations and came up in a lengthy discussion in the SPEC
    benchmark (which has a qsort test based on BSD and lots of other tests
    that use that qsort implementation).  Their "fix" was to degrade
    everything to char swaps (i.e., eliminate the optimization) which SPEC
    rejected on simple principle of the benchmark already being published,
    but to my eye it would have negatively affected the benchmark anyways,
    so good call...
    
    A better fix I think is the one proposed here where we keep the
    optimization, and simply rely on casting the pointer through to a
    uintptr_t instead of subtracting null.  Since we're solely dealing
    with long/int/char alignments, it should be a safe enough assumption
    (at least insofar as being as reliable as subtracting null) and a fix
    that will keep LTO optimization happy.
    
    Original error was:
    
    error: performing pointer subtraction with a null pointer has undefined behavior [-Werror,-Wnull-pointer-subtraction]
    
    While a different qsort variant, relevant summary at:

    step closer to getting art building by default.
    
    main complexity is that it needs appleseed and huge swath of boost.  appleseed's binary installer provides libs and headers for its libs, but not boost's headers, so there's a potential incompatibility.  still link all of appleseed's libs and the swath of boost libs appleseed bundles.  main limitation remaining seems to be that libappleseed doesn't have an rpath, so at least on mac we have to run from build dir with: DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/appleseed:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib bin/art

    When running ert, turn on the display of the embedded framebuffer in
    underlay mode if it isn't already enabled.  Without this the visual
    output of ert is hidden by default, which is not ideal.  If there's a
    use case for running it without enabling the fb by default, we can add
    an option to support that.

    Add libqtcad default binding toggles to the views
    
    There are two conflicting goals here - one is to have the default
    QtCADView widget be as functional as possible for applications, without
    requiring a lot of additional work on the application's part to set up
    what we think of as basic viewing functionality.  On the other hand, we
    want the application to be able to support customizing the bindings - in
    which case, low-level baked-in bindings might interfere.  Moreover, the
    question of app level bindings can't be fully resolved at the libqtcad
    level, since the desired app-level "bound" actions may be more involved
    than just altering the view struct and may need more information to
    execute than is available at the libqtcad level (ged commands being the
    obvious example.)
    
    To support both of these scenarios, we add toggles that will allow the
    parent application to opt in or out of the default, pre-baked MGED style
    bindings built in to the widgets.  If the application opts out by
    disabling them, it is then up to the application itself to implement its
    own solution - but this way the widget itself will not do anything
    unexpected if the parent app doesn't implement a binding that is defined
    by default (after all, that omission in the parent may be intentional.)

    to whether we compile 3rd party codes, and anything else is a
    configuration setting (thus intently avoiding BUILD and ENABLE).
    Using monikers that are as brief as possible while disambiguating
    other use.  Noteworthy, intentionally replaced "DEBUG" with
    "DEBUGGING" to avoid conflation/confusion with the DEBUG build type.

    Get Shift-n working for NIRT shooting in qged
    
    This is a rather interesting case, in that (unlike the majority of key
    bindings associated with views) running nirt requires much more
    extensive knowledge of the application level logic rather than just
    manipulating the libqtcad widget's view state.
    
    The two choices are to associate data with the widgets at various levels
    so libqtcad has enough info to call ged_exec in a binding, or to have
    the application handle the more complex invocation at its own level
    rather than in the libqtcad generic bindings.  The latter is a bit
    complex, but fortunately most of the machinery is already in place from
    the work getting the tree highlighting to respond to mouse events, which
    raises similar issues.
    
    We define a key event handler in the application level event filter, and
    use Qt's ability to report the currently focused widget and the parent
    widgets of that widget to see if our focus is within the central view.
    
    All of this logic (both in libqtcad and qged) should be considered
    experimental, since we will also need application-level runtime
    configurable mechanisms for defining such bindings.

    Try to adjust the xxhash logic for Coverity issues
    
    New Coverity scanner doesn't like some of the individual XXH64_update
    calls, reporting out of bounds access in the internals.  At a glance
    it looks like small objects may be part of the problem?  See if we
    can simply feed the structs in whole to the update routine, rater than
    calling out the individual slots.  If the updating works correctly this
    would be much better anyway, since we could adjust the structs more
    easily...
    
    If this either doesn't work for view updating or doesn't clear the
    issue, I'll have to dissect more carefully what the internals of the
    xxhash routine are wanting as input...

    Eliminate the separate libged DM management
    
    Rather than trying to track the display manager pointers separately at
    the GED level, we will instead rely on the gvp->dmp pointers.  These can
    be updated by client codes without requiring them to know about GED, and
    as long as GED keeps track of the views it will also know how to find
    all the dmps.  The responsibility of code attaching a dmp to a view is
    thus to assign the struct dm pointer to the view's dmp slot, since the
    broader codebase won't know about the DM except through its view.

    updated gltf importer with preliminary mesh import support.  meshes in nearly all encodings appear to import cleanly, but there is some issue remaining.  meshes converted to bots display correctly in wireframe and opengl in mged/archer, but do not raytrace correctly.  possibly implies some issue in the bot data structure setup, but this is significant progress regardless, and sets the stage for creating a proper gcv plugin.

    This one is user visible - corrected librt to again allow lookup of object names containing forward slashes.

commit c299266b31344db1ceca492cdbb635051cfbe281

    Correct db_lookup logic for name with '/' char
    
    Back in 2018, when I added SVN commit r71281 I asserted that it wasn't
    valid to have the forward slash '/' in an object name, and consequently
    its presence indicated we have a path.  Unfortunately, while that
    probably *should* be true, it turns out there exist examples in the wild
    that do define their names with forward slashes.  It is possible to
    create an example of this in MGED with: make "test.s/" sph
    
    Accordingly, adjust db_lookup to first try a normal lookup on the
    provided string without doing anything path related.  If that doesn't
    work, we can then go ahead and try and interpret the supplied string as
    a path, but if we don't first try the literal string we simply can't get
    the correct directory pointer to manipulate in the "test.s/" case.
    
    The presence of such a name does probably indicate either a mistake or
    some sort of automated conversion naming, but regardless of how it got

    Add some logic for duplicate comb tree entries
    
    Accidentally tested a case I considered early on, but hadn't gotten to
    yet - if a comb has two absolutely identical entries (name, matrix, op,
    etc.) we have a problem.  (In this case two successive invocations of g
    box.r cone.r with moss.g was the trigger.) The gInstance definition,
    based on the definition data in the comb, is not unique.  The ONLY thing
    that makes the two entries distinct is they have different positions in
    the comb tree.
    
    Deal with this by incorporating a counter into the hashing, and then
    have the tree walk make sure it's not encountered the current hash in
    its walk before we proceed to assign and use it.  This implementation
    probably isn't the most efficient possible in that we start over from
    zero each time we hit a duplicate rather than stashing the current
    highest cnt state for each "0" hash, but hopefully these cases will be
    rare enough and small enough that such an optimization won't be needed.
    
    This is effectively the final uniqueness guarantee for anything stored
    in a comb tree - if we find anything that would otherwise have been a
    duplicate, the counter will keep incrementing until the hash IS unique
    within the tree.

    rework dynamic library closing, now deferred to avoid racing.
    
    closing dynamically opened libraries on demand was causing a problem
    (segfault) on Mac due to our use of C++ constructors/destructors to
    load and unload plugins.  when dynamically loading a library that
    causes its dependencies to also be dynamically loaded (e.g., loading
    libged-dm loads libdm which loads all the dm plugins), there was a
    problem when the libraries were closed.  libraries (libdm in this
    case) were being unloaded while we were still in that library's
    destructor. the plugin that caused that library to be loaded,
    libged-dm, was already unloaded so it would crash while still in the
    destructor in the process of unloading that library's plugins.
    
    the solution employed here is to defer closing so that the constructor
    can complete, and introduce an explicit purge function bu_dlunload()
    that actually unloads all the libraries.  this only happens when libbu
    is unloaded (again using the destructor method), or bu_dlunload() can
    be manually called to force it.

    Improve behavior of QgModel/QgTreeView during edit
    
    Somewhat reluctantly, switching to triggering a full model reset after
    every ged command that indicates the .g file has changed.  Not sure if
    that's going to be problematic for large files, but conceptually it's
    fair enough - in principle, any GED command CAN change the whole
    database structure.  In order for this to work while keeping the tree
    usable, we have to restore the open/close state after the model is reset
    (by default it will collapse everything.)  This is a bit tricky, and the
    working approach so far appears to be 1) cache the open/close state in
    the QgItem when the view sends expansion or collapse signals, 2)
    creating a QgTreeView slot that is triggered in response to a db change
    signal from the model and 3) iterate over the QgItems in the view slot
    comparing their current expansion status to their stored status, and
    expanding any that aren't currently expanded but report that they should
    be expanded.

    Refactor more logic to the gInstance level
    
    Primarily doing this for readability, to make it easier to manipulate
    the Qt level logic while trying to figure out how to handle model
    updating in response to .g changes, but this also has the side effect of
    making more of this logic reusable for a hypothetical model not
    involving Qt.

    Note some problems with current approach
    
    Using moss, the following sequence generally leads to trouble:
    
    expand all.g, expand ellipse.r
    g ellipse.r cone.r
    expand ellipse.r/cone.r
    rm ellipse.r cone.r
    
    The last operation produces internal Qt indexing errors of one form or
    another.  Trying to add back in the row removal doesn't work - rowCount
    is getting out of sync with the Qt state, or various other odd issues.
    
    It may be fetchMore isn't a good place to yank invalid rows - if so,
    need to figure out something else...

    Apparently I don't need the separate beginRemoveRows/endRemoveRows calls, and the beginResetModel/endResetModel calls were unsurprisingly what was causing the tree view collapse - what I do appear to need is notification for Qt from the callbacks via a signal that the model has changed and updating is needed for the view.

    Work on defining a close command in libged
    
    In principle, we want open, close and man to be libged commands rather
    than having to have qged define them - they have sane meanings in the
    library context, as long as the parent gedp remains viable.
    
    In theory even "exit" might be implemented as a libged command, if we
    have it return the BRLCAD_EXIT flag the way gsh's version currently does
    to allow applications to do their own cleanup...  It would be nice if we
    can manage it, since these commands are common to essentially all
    applications wanting to present a GED command interface.  The
    application would have to have logic to check the return flags and
    handle the various cases, but eliminating the need for layered command
    execution on top of ged_exec would be a significant overall win for
    simplicity.

    Merge in changes to support building with Qt6
    
    Take the early work done to test building with Qt6 and make it available
    as part of the main build, while also preserving the option to use Qt5.
    Qt6 porting isn't quite done (there are a couple places where settings
    are just turned off until we find the right Qt6 answer) but this gets us
    most of the way there.
    
    Aside from an eventual need to keep up with the current platform, mainly
    doing this because Qt6 is somewhat easier for me to build and I want to
    see if a debug build can offer insights on what I've done wrong in the
    QgModel work to provoke crashes in the main Qt model/view logic.

    Don't make fast4-g region names for skipped bots
    
    Customer report of spurious high level groups in fast4-g conversions
    using the -c option to constrain the conversion to a particular subset
    of the model.  One of the make_region_name calls was getting triggered
    even when the region_id was in a skipped range, which was artificially
    increasing the maximum active region_id and resulting in empty region
    combs being activated for higher level component numbers.
    
    Fix is to guard the bot make_region_name call with a skip_region check.

    Like MGED, we want gsh to not interject its prompt into the output if

    appears to be fairly generic) make a "bu_interactive" function
    encapsulating the necessary tests.

    This isn't ideal (we've not fixed the libged/librt migration issue
    manifesting in Archer, and so have to leave the implementation of the
    libged command versions of this logic in place) but this setup lets us
    complete a no-Tcl build while still generating the sample .g files.
    Need to do validation of them against the asc2g variants, but this is a
    significant piece of the "core" build functionality that was previously
    not working without Tcl.  Wanted to get this stood up, even with work
    still to do, so the implementation isn't buried too deeply in the
    history.

    Focus until now has been on the .g portions of the model, which have to be solid if we're to build on them.  Start looking now at the Qt portion of the model interface - more extensive testing will ultimately need the interactive tree view, and for that we need the full implementation.

    Simplify - make the db_ls flags additive
    
    Rather than special casing the TOPS + CYCLIC situation, adjust the db_ls
    logic so the flags are additive - that is, if DB_LS_PRIM and DB_LS_COMB
    are set, both primitives and combs will match rather than neither
    matching.  This should be more useful generally, and the TOPS + CYCLIC
    case is no longer an unexpected one-off."

    First try at supporting cyclic reporting in db_ls
    
    For the qged work, we'll need some way to handle cyclic paths in the
    model.  Because a cyclic path object has no non-zero reference counts,
    it is not a traditional "tops" object and thus will not be reported by
    tops - a comb structure of A u B u A would result in an empty tree view,
    despite the fact that there are objects present in such a .g file.
    
    For display purposes, we need to regard cyclic objects as "tops" objects
    so we can see them (ideally we will also flag them as problematic
    visually, but that's for later.)  Initially, we need a way to detect the
    cycles and report them - this experiments with a db_ls flag that alters
    the TOPS reporting.

    types into generic BRLCAD_* return types.  It happens that numerically
    OK and ERROR lined up, so this shouldn't cause any surprises even if
    code is doing the wrong thing and relying on numerical values, and going
    forward we can just use BRLCAD_OK and BRLCAD_ERROR for everything.

    Make some notes about libged+libgcv for ascv5
    
    Hitting an interesting limitation with using libged in a libgcv plugin -
    at least on Linux, attempting to do so is crashing when the app trys to
    call the libged plugin cleanup on application exit.  Not really sure why
    - neither gdb nor the AddressSanitizer can shed much light on it so far
    - but it seems to be triggered in some fashion by the dlclose calls for
    the libged plugin handles.  Assuming this is an OS limitation, will need
    to do a bit of refactoring to put the needed ascv5 logic in librt (which
    is arguably where it belongs anyway, at least until libg is stood up...)

    Revert "Remove old burst code"
    
    This reverts commit d0e5cc6b2855e397e133ec299642b0e3fc72e01a.
    
    since burst's outputs are inputs to another tool outside our control,
    removing burst is not minimally impacting unless/until we demonstrate
    it produces the same output.  there's no unit tests demonstrating this
    yet.  there is a regression test, but it doesn't do a comparison.
    
    if output and behavior has been manually confirmed, then we should
    document what did change (via manpage updates and NEWS any changes)
    and name the new binary burst instead of nburst to avoid affecting
    downstream more than necessary.

    I doubt this is really necessary in the init call - I don't think the
    init function is supposed to be called as part of the parallel
    processing - but since Coverity flags it (the other two assignments to
    val are guarded and it sees that) and since it shouldn't hurt anything,
    go ahead and guard the initial setting as well to clear the report.

    undo antipattern of checking for null before calling free.
    
    this was done just to avoid bu_free() blathering about NULL, intended to catch bad book-keeping, but was more typically just if-checked as the pointer being released often came from a different context.  now that bu_free() handles NULL silently like stdlib, these checks can be removed.  care is just needed to keep post-santify logic intact that sets NULL after free.

Date:   Thu Jan 27 11:00:13 2022 -0500

    no longer make bu_free() blather on NULL free, instead matching stdlib's silent handling.
    
    keeping the -1L test as a way for callers to detect corruption in their book-keeping, though.  malloc's bu debugging interace was removed, otherwise that'd be an alternative to print NULLs when debugging is enabled -- might make sense to ressurrect it, but hopefully not.

    bombing) to catch them or do what libc does and simply ignore them if they are no
    longer useful to us.

    Move libnmg only structs from header to C file
    
    These I/O structs are now internal to libnmg - librt doesn't have any
    knowledge of them (we're also removing remaining unused duplicate
    functions from librt now.)
    
    librt's nmg.c file still has some nmg processing routines, but those
    should pertain to tasks like nmg<->primitive conversions or boolean
    evaluation of comb trees - i.e., operations requiring knowledge of librt
    data types.

    See if this lets us decouple from db4.h
    
    Since the v4 version of NMG was coupled to a union of multiple types,
    try an approach were we define a second union of just what we need from
    that union for this purpose, and pass in the sizeof() information for
    the full union record from the caller (since we don't want libnmg to
    know about about librt's data types to be able to make that calculation
    itself.)

    Experiment with moving NMG I/O to libnmg
    
    The serialization and de-serialization of NMG data structures is quite
    tightly coupled to the in-memory storage.  To properly decouple librt
    and libnmg, we need to move the parts of this logic that are aware of
    the internal NMG details out of librt - librt's role would then be
    limited to the bu_external; pass it in to libnmg for import, and write
    out the bu_external provided by libnmg for export.

    Note issues with removing NMG attr structs
    
    Make a quick try at folding the shell bbox min and max points into the
    shell container and removing shell_a.  For NMG itself it looks doable,
    but librt defines export-to-disk logic that specifically encodes shell_a
    containers - this implies that the on-disk format itself requires these
    structures.
    
    If possible, need to get the serialization/deserialization code out of
    librt and into libnmg (have it encode/decode to bu_externals or whatever
    container is appropriate, then hand back to librt for the .g database
    part...)

    Group the make/kill routines with their types
    
    This breakout may not ultimately be how we keep this organized - the
    topology relationships mean each of the use types needs to know a lot
    about other types, so it may be more sensible to just define the full
    topology type set all at once up front.  Main motivation for the current
    setup is to try to get a feel for how we can set up an incremental,
    bottom-to-top vertex->model unit testing system and what needs to be
    tested at each level...

    If unit testing of libnmg is going to become essential, will have to
    understand the various components' relationships to each other.  One
    possible way to help with that is to break nmg.h down into sub-headers,
    as has been done with other libs.

    Remove NMG mem tracking hack added for facetize
    
    The tracking and nmg_destroy call was just a hackish workaround for
    problems libnmg has with freeing up memory (or problems our client code
    has calling the right routines, or maybe both.)  Remove it, and remove
    the nmg_* wrappers around the basic libbu memory calls.

    Checkpoint some work on an NMG use of bu_list
    
    Coverity doesn't like the memory behavior around libnmg/mk.c1558.
    Trying to understand what is happening and what needs to happen when -
    this may require some unit testing of libnmg functions so we can poke
    the right logic in a self-contained fashion.  These changes don't break
    the "make check" target on Linux, but that's not saying a whole lot...
    Not at all convinced this is correct or properly freeing memory yet
    (probably not, in fact) - more to come.

    Alter clear_list memory cleanup for GED check cmd
    
    This one is a legit crasher.  The BU_LIST_FOR iteration can't do the
    clean up of the bu_list containers itself (at least, not this way.) Just
    do the cleanup of the non-bu_list-container memory with the for loop
    (which bu_list_free can't do), and then let bu_list_free take care of
    the more finicky cleanup needed for the bu_list containers themselves.

    Add a place to hang basic bu_list tests.
    
    There are a lot of Coverity reports that seem to pertain to bu_list
    behavior, but in most cases it's difficult to follow the logic - the
    callback stacks can be rather deep.  Set up a simple bu_test harness to
    poke and prod various loop behaviors to see if we can identify what the
    problems might be in a simpler context.

    Experiment with suppressing a Coverity warning
    
    CID 1488777 reports "bad_sizeof: Taking the size of &internal, which is
    the address of an object, is suspicious" for RT_CK_DB_INTERNAL(&internal)
    in the libgcv plugin file decimate/decimate.c:60  I think(?) this is
    the intended logic here, so see if we can tell Coverity that.
    
    Better practice would be to make some sort of model entry to cover this
    case... not sure if the model mechanism covers this case yet, but if we
    can figure that out this comment should be removed in favor of a model
    based solution.

    Sanity check inputs to bu_setenv
    
    CID 1488820 is reporting a tainted string getting passed to bu_setenv.
    Not sure if these checks by themselves will clear the issue, but I think
    the point is that av[arg] string is not guaranteed to contain a valid
    environment variable assignment.

    Adjust position tracking in strnstr
    
    Coverity spotted some logically dead code - hpos starts as zero, and the
    way the for loop was set up that resulted in a failed test that
    immediately halted the for loop.  Adjust to do the increment inside the
    loop body, rather than in a location where the hpos value itself acts as
    a condition test.

    Start working on cyclic path reporting in librt
    
    The libged lint functionality has the ability to identify and report
    cyclic paths.  Going to need some form of that for the libqtcad .g model
    (if it can be done with a fast enough performance) so start thinking
    about shifting it down into librt.  Haven't refactored the ged logic to
    use this yet - need to set up some unit tests and check new logic
    against the old version before removing it.

    Test Coverity's reaction to a refactor
    
    Having trouble understanding why g2asc.c is triggering CID 1488403.  I'm
    wondering if the Coverity scanner isn't properly unwinding
    BU_LIST_WHILE.  That macro is doing a new assignment of headp->forw to
    mp, but if Coverity is instead interpreting BU_LIST_WHILE as a function
    call that uses the just-freed mp value it might explain why it looks
    like a use-after-free error to the scanner.  This probably isn't a
    general solution, but in this case its easy enough to refactor to not
    use the macro - let's see if another scan still reports the issue.

    Merge pull request #8 from treydinges/chris-appleseed-cmake-update
    
    Update to art with a slew of significant changes from Chris McGregor
    
    This adds support for the set command to control the number of samples, it lets are utilize OSL shaders from appleseed that are set on objects via material objects (optical "OSL" property), and it should support most of the RTUIF commands (e.g., az/el) although the code was reverted to a +y coordinate frame which results in a 90-degree rotated output image.  Most significant in this pull is the conversion to registering each region individually as an appleseed object, so material properties and color can be applied per-object.  There is one big performance-impacting hack in the code -- a per ray string comparison.  Current librt rt_shootray() hit callback is initialized with the whole scene, but needs to report only hits for a single specific object at a time.  Hack was to check if it's the right object by way of a string path-to-region comparison.  Needs separate per-object rtip's or a numeric handle (e.g., pointer) to each region otherwise (depending on whether we think librt or appleseed's spatial partitioning is faster).  Outstanding work from Chris.

    Use the %p specifier (standard) to print pointers
    
    CID 1488175 is indicating pc->pkc_inbuf isn't NULL terminated because
    it's contents come from read (which is true) and therefore snprintf has
    a problem with it.  That would be true if we were trying to print the
    pkc_inbuf contents as a string, but I think the intent here is to print
    pointers, which should make NULL termination moot.  (Printing the
    pointers here is of questionable utility, but that's another
    discussion...)  See if using %p is more acceptable to Coverity.

    what's prompting that.  First guess is something stale in the new_plane
    pointer, which was defined at the top level function scope, so bringing
    it local to make behavior clearer.

    Parse_ScalarConstant needs an array
    
    CID 1495078 - Parse_ScalarConstant's numerical path assigns the number
    to four slots in an array, but as the caller incremented the available
    output array got smaller - result, Out-of-bounds access if the numerical
    case activated.  Rather than passing in vec directly, use a temporary
    array so Parse_ScalarConstant has enough room.

    Sanity check yyruleno value
    
    CID 1127262.  If I'm understanding this correctly, Coverity is spotting
    the bounds check in the debug printing statement, interpreting this as
    an indication that yyruleno might exceed the array size, and (assuming
    that's true) then points out that if yyruleno CAN do that it would
    result in a problem when the array contents are accessed later on.
    
    Just do the check up front, to make sure we don't get into this logic
    with a problematic yyruleno, and warn if we hit it.  Not sure if the
    debugging logic was doing this check on general principles or they had
    an issue at some point...

    Clean up some memory inside the lemon parser.
    
    CID 280107, 280144.  A quick trial indicates that we'll need other
    changes if we update lemon.c and lempar.c to the latest upstream
    versions, so for now just mod our copies to free the memory.

    CID 1488714 - using pointer to individual char as string array
    
    db_str2op expects a NULL terminated const char * array - it skips
    leading whitespace with a while(*str) loop, so it needs to know when to
    stop.  Use null terminated strings as input instead of pointers to
    individual chars.

    Make the fb names static, to match dm names
    
    Oof.  Writing down the details on this one, as I doubt I'll remember...
    
    The start was turning on both the AddressSanitizer and Qt.  When doing
    so, most programs suddenly began reporting memory leaks.  However, the
    report was rather cryptic, being four entries similar to this one:
    
    ==1262202==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks
    
    Direct leak of 21 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
        #0 0x498087 in posix_memalign (build/src/libdm/tests/dm_test+0x498087)
        #1 0x7f4e90e53675 in alloc brlcad/src/libbu/malloc.c:129:10
        #2 0x7f4e90e53400 in bu_malloc brlcad/src/libbu/malloc.c:167:12
        #3 0x7f4e90ee1c02 in bu_strdupm brlcad/src/libbu/str.c:165:17
        #4 0x7f4e87dcd3e9  (<unknown module>)
        #5 0x7f4e87dcdea5  (<unknown module>)
        #6 0x7f4e9650eb89  (/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2+0x11b89)
    
    I wasn't immediately sure if the unknown module error was related to the
    plugin loading, and spent a lot of time trying to find a string memory
    issue in dm_init.cpp.  After that proved fruitless, other than to
    confirm that the error disappeared if i removed the bu_dlclose-ing of
    the handles saved at initialization, I began to look for ways to decode
    the "unknown module" entries.  That led to the following issue:
    https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/89 which describes the
    problem ASan has with dynamic libraries.  Comments indicated that it
    would see real issues, but won't report which dynamic library they come
    from (and there are no plans to fix this anytime soon... grr...).  In
    fairness, valgrind can see the error too but also has the same reporting
    problem; it appears to be ubiquitous.
    
    Fortunately, we have an alternative due to the way our plugin system and
    test apps work - we can simply add and remove .so files to the directory
    and see how the error reporting changes to zero in on which file(s) are
    triggering the problem.  Doing so quickly made apparent what should have
    been obvious in retrospect - two of the errors each were coming from the
    Qt and swrast plugins, which had been off in earlier testing.
    
    Since there was no backtrace beyond the bu_strdupm call itself, and
    there were two errors per file, the suspect was the bu_strdup calls
    initializing the "char *" names for the fb structures.  The C files use
    static strings (which is why the non-Qt plugins didn't show the issue),
    but C++ doesn't tolerate the type mismatch.  The original hack
    workaround was just to bu_strdup and create a (char *) string, but as
    the leak detectors correctly note this also means there's no way to
    clean up the allocated memory.
    
    As far as I can tell there is no reason for these strings to be editable
    (char *) strings - the dm container's equivalents are static.  This
    commit removes any logic assuming if_name is dynamic, and also removes
    the bu_strdup hack from Qt and swrast.

    Hide AddressSanitizer flags behind an option
    
    We don't want this to accidentally activate if -lasan is no longer a
    requirement someday - BRL-CAD's code isn't ready for it yet.  In
    particular, the LeakSanitizer trips up on the rt_free_rti/rt_clean
    tangle as well as _db_walk_subtree.  The former may need elimination of
    the rt_uniresource global to properly clean up, and the latter is deep
    in the raytracing core and will have to be approached very carefully.
    
    For convenience, here are the backtraces:

    Add some env2c workaround logic for -lasan
    
    Well this is wacky... apparently adding the -fsanitize=address flag
    changes the results of the FindThreads test, causing it to not add
    -lpthread. If we don't use the flag consistently everywhere after we
    start using that flag the address+Threads result will break independent
    logic that's not using the -fsanatize setting.

    Ah - at least with clang 12 on Linux, the compiler test needs -lasan for the flag test to succeed.  Leaving commented out as actually enabling the flag appears to cause breakage.

    Simplify static analysis script
    
    With the count down, it's no longer as beneficial to separate things out
    into per-library reports - just assemble a single report for the all
    target, and use the total report count as a criteria for failure - like
    our other checks, if the count rises over the current known rate report
    failure.  We'll lower the number as issues are resolved.

    Including librt headers pulls in openNURBS, which has a lot of
    implications for things like needing warning suppressed.  Use an ifdef
    guard to only expose and use these functions where necessary to limit
    the scope of the necessary adjustment.

    Try adding sentinel files to the perplex/lemon cpy
    
    Grr.  Getting random failures in the stepcode building, mostly on the
    Github runners but occasionally on normal desktops as well.  Symptoms
    are an internal operation of the stepcode build erring out complaining
    about not being able to do I/O on one of the files that needs to be
    copied, but when you check the file is there.  Historically that's
    happened when disk I/O isn't quite keeping up with processing or
    parallel operations end up colliding.
    
    Traditional solution has been to add sentinel files that are only
    created after the original operation is done.  See if that helps here.

    Watch analyzer results for osmesa, utahrle, polyt2ri
    
    Having gotten these clean (at least with clang 12), lets keep them that
    way.  utahrle doesn't have an active upstream, our poly2tri is
    significantly altered from the upstream version, and osmesa is an
    extraction of Mesa 7.0.4's OpenGL 2.1 software-only rasterizer - the
    current upstream code is now completely different.
    
    Realistically Tktable and Tkhtml (particularly Tkhtml) should also fall
    into this category, but they're not as trivial to set up in the test
    script since they may need Tcl/Tk built from src/other/ext first (and,
    unlike the other three libs, the Tk widgets should eventually be phased
    out in favor of Qt functionality anyway...)
    
    OpenNURBS is in a separate class - basically, unlike the other src/other
    libs not in ext, it does have an active upstream - we just need to
    maintain it in src/other because of the significant number of patches we
    apply to it.

    More adjustments to surfaceintersect arrays
    
    Previous problem wasn't quite what I thought - assignment was indeed
    making a full copy, so we also need to delete.  Also need a few more
    SimpleArray -> ClassArray switches.

    ON_SimpleArray -> ON_ClassArray
    
    Sean spotted this, and it looks like it may have been a significant
    systematic mistake in my early NURBS brep coding.  ON_SimpleArray can't
    always be used - per opennurbs_array.h, ON_SimpleArray "should not be
    used for arrays of classes that require explicit construction,
    destruction, or copy operators."  That probably means we've got a lot of
    inappropriate uses of ON_SimpleArray at play.  I tended to try and treat
    pointers to ON_* objects as being inserted into and managed by
    ON_SimpleArray essentially as if they were C arrays of pointers, and
    that looks to be incorrect.  Good chance this is the root cause behind a
    lot of the more obscure memory issues clang static analyzer is finding
    with the various brep related codes...

    Simplify static analyzer script
    
    With more experimentation and shrinking error count, the simpler thing
    to do looks to be to just use the "all" target after the libraries are
    built to collectively check the remaining logic.
    
    If we can get to a fully clean build, we'll probably be able to simplify
    much further and dispense with the preliminary library building stage -
    just doing an "all" build after the src/other and misc/tools components
    are built should return a clean build, and if not we are unlikely to
    need to break the outputs out into individual per-library reports.

    Generating some clang static analyzer errors - just removing as the
    simplest step.  Probably not too hard to fix, but we never got this to
    the point where we were able to generate geometry and the Vehicle Sketch
    Pad software (OpenVSP, http://openvsp.org/) originally developed by NASA
    has the ability to generate STEP files.  Unless someone wants to pick
    this up (in which case the VCS has it) the better investment of effort
    is to  firm up our step-g importer's ability to bring in OpenVSP
    exports.

    Clear a couple warnings, but still concerns here
    
    Rework this logic to clear some leaked memory warnings, but not
    comfortable with trimmed_faces Append being before the m_innerloop
    building for loop (or more precisely, why that would make any
    difference.)  The behavior I'm seeing suggests that the Append is doing
    something to the internals of trimmed_face that result in memory loss if
    m_innerloop is populated, but I don't see why since we're appending a
    pointer rather than making a struct copy...

    A number of these seem to have the same root cause - namely, SetCapacity zeros out the memory of m_a if it gets negative or zero numbers, and overflows push the logic into this territory.  Not sure yet what the correct answer is here, some of the calculations that might overflow are within openNURBS functions...  Maybe time to see if newer openNURBS handles these cases better?

    Start looking at libbrep null ref returns
    
    Clang static analyzer report for libbrep has a number of rather obtuse
    "Returning null reference" reports.  These usually report a reference
    coming from from opennurbs_array_defs.h, but after some digging the
    problems generally seem to be with our initialization and (lack of)
    error handling in libbrep itself.
    
    This is probably going to be one of those situations where addressing
    one issue (by, say, bailing with an error condition instead of
    continuing with invalid inputs) will propagate to other issues (i.e. a
    caller now needs to handle the error condition it was previously
    ignoring.)  No help for it, but the result is that it may be a while
    before this work really begins to consistently drive down the static
    analyzer error count.

    Some of these conversions don't do what they appear to, but they should be harmless.  More interesting, the codeql plugin caught some printf formatting errors in the code.

    This cnt reset assignment is used only by debugging code that is currently commented out.  Reluctant to just delete the commented out code - getting the right debugging msging in for NURBS logic can be involved - but we eventually need a better long term solution to this category of problem.  (Maybe a LIBRT_NURBS_DEBUG_VERBOSITY env var or some such that controls verbosity reporting for these types of logic?)

    Dead assignments

    Reduce the r50164 additions to their core
    
    OK, it's getting clearer.  The key point of the additional code is to
    satisfy subsequent filtering code by setting hit_vpriv[X], and to do
    so a block of code was copied over to do so.  However, with the
    exception of hit_vpriv[X] itself, which has other inputs being used to
    set it, the other calculations all depend on unset values.
    
    See if we can strip this down to its current core functionality.  Not
    sure this is where it should ultimately land (ideally we probably want
    all these values to be meaningfully set, if TIE allows for that, since
    other functions do seem to reference them) but at least we want to avoid
    the impression of meaningful number assignments when we don't have the
    input values to back them.

    Zero init rather than use uninitialized
    
    The hit_vpriv code came in back in 2012 to address disappearing BoT
    segments, but it looks like in the process it ends up using some
    uninitialized variables.  This isn't a proper fix, but it bounds the
    scope of the problem.

    Reorganize a bit to make the analyzer logic clear
    
    This one is a puzzler...  Even when I reorganize the logic as in this
    commit, the analyzer is assuming end_orad' is <= field 'dist' at line
    2567 and then immediately turning around as assuming 'end_orad' is >
    field 'dist' on line 2572.  end_orad is passed in as a number and tol is
    const - the only thing I can think of is maybe the analyzer is allowing
    for the possibility that something else (another thread?) is altering
    tol->dist independent of this function?

    Make a stab at consolidating memory lookup code
    
    GCT has some code that looks up available memory and page size.  We
    needed similar information for facetize, and the beginnings of a libbu
    capability to provide that information were started a few years back.
    See if we can consolidate the two.
    
    This is unfortunately one of those cases where the only APIs that
    provide the info we need are platform specific, and the terminology
    isn't uniform between systems either.  This will probably need tweaking
    and refinement over time, but at least get the ball rolling.

    rename v4 material record id from ID_MATERIAL to ID_COLORTAB
    
    this is to make room for new v5 'material' database objects being implemented
    by a team of students at TAMU.  this change is minimally impacting as a simple
    rename, but is also only affecting v4 API that has now been out of date for a
    very long time.  moreover, the new label is more reflective of the data held
    by the record as it's color table information defined by ident ranges and rgb
    values.

    Check found before returning -1.
    
    This one has potential implications and needs testing.  Logic added in
    r60186 adds a fallback test to look at pt instead of from, but as
    implemented despite doing checks for within-tol-but-not-at
    BREP_SAME_POINT_TOLERANCE in the latter stage it only reports success if
    the result actually IS within BREP_SAME_POINT_TOLERANCE.  This change
    mirrors the behavior of the "from" test above, and may report success
    where previously we would not have.  Don't know yet what (if anything)
    that might change.

    Don't static analyze obj re2c generated code
    
    There isn't really a good solution for this that I can see - even if
    there is a theoretical way to update re2c to avoid dead assignment
    issues (and at this point I'm not convinced there is) it's not practical
    from a resource availability standpoint to try at this point.  To avoid
    false positives, since we eventually want to get the build to a point
    where it is clean and we can enforce keeping it that way, use a clang
    mechanism to avoid the errors from the generated file.  I don't like it,
    and if clang adds a way in the future to do more targeted disablement of
    just dead store reporting we should use that, but in the meantime this
    will avoid producing reports from the machine generated C++ file.

    Set up to supply a dbip pointer in struct ged
    
    Of 1490 instances matching the pattern gedp->ged_wdbp, 1150 of them
    appear to be doing so to get the dbip pointer from wdbp.  Also, if a ged
    command isn't going to work with the rt_wdb structure, we shouldn't
    really be requiring it for other commands - i.e. a ged_init without a
    wdbp should still enable as much of the libged logic as can be used with
    just a dbip, and fail cleanly for functionality requiring a non-NULL
    wdbp.  Set the stage for some experiments.

    Don't eliminate children from items on close
    
    Archer's tree remembers what subtrees were open and closed if a higher
    level object is opened or closed - this is desirable behavior, so think
    about how it might be achieved within the Qt context.  Basically we
    don't want to wipe out pre-existing QgItems on close - keep them, just
    don't display them or their subtrees.  It's only when one is found to be
    invalid that it and its subtrees need to go.

    Checkpoint work on updating comb children items
    
    Starting to grapple now with the true core of the problem.  Need to
    figure out a reasonable way to update QgItems in subtrees in response to
    database comb tree changes without wiping out the whole tree and
    starting over (which would lose all the QgItem state related to
    open/closed children - we can't preserve all of that if the tree has
    changed, but we'd like to minimize the previously open tree items that
    are suddenly closed after an edit.)

    limit large memory allocation to prevent maliciousness
    
    CID 1489217 found tainted allocations.  since pkg sizes are
    potentially very large (e.g., sending a large file as a single
    package), we do want to allow large sizes, but still need to impose
    some upper limit.  using the max size of ssize_t (i.e., max int) minus
    the two bytes being added during malloc() since that's nominally what
    a valid caller might maximally send.

    Going to need some way to test QgInstance et. al.
    
    There are going to be a lot of pieces to the Qt .g model, and we need
    some way to incrementally test small parts of the logic without the
    complexity of standing up the all-up Qt widget.  Add in a simple program
    to read in a .g file and exercise the data structures.  Eventually
    pieces of this may mature enough to migrate either to libraries or qged,
    but for the moment its scope is just "development tool".

    three places in the code initialize a new shootray status before
    spatial partitioning traversal (rt_advance_to_next_cell).  two of them
    failed to init a field to zero after a struct copy, one of which was
    followed by a goto into the spatial partitioning traversal loop where
    an uninit'd variable was incremented, could've been printed.  the
    three places were refactored into a function so that the same init
    would occur.
    
    unlikely user vis as it's a debug statement and involved infinite
    solids.

    lastest gcc is much better at tracking typedef types and noticing
    when functions are declared with one type and defined with other
    type-compatible parameters.
    
    used to be a problem long ago with some compilers not working well
    with typedef types as parameters (e.g., vect_t vs fastf_t *) but
    this forunately/hopefully is a vestige.  updates tested on linux
    and mac, so hopefully windows behaves.

    re-address locale_t header issue
    
    need to be more specific to accommodate linux and mac simultaneously.
    don't include xlocale.h with older glibc (pre 2.26) but do include it
    for non-glibc environments since we don't know (and it fits prior).

    fixed pixscale inappropriate ioctl for device fread bug

    fix apparent pixscale off-by-1 when downsampling
    
    was causing a confusing/useless fread ioctl error to get printed due
    to short read.  while the buflines fix makes the fread go away,
    distinguish and print a more useful message when reading less than
    expected.

    Stash minimal change set needed to build with Qt6
    
    Not 100% correct (in particular need to identify what replaces
    setMargins - we're getting a margin around the console) but this gets
    our Qt code compiling with Qt6.
    
    Will need to take a look at mouse bindings on the Mac - using a
    "standard" Mac mouse, our default shift grips configuration isn't very
    useful.

    Shift Eigen from src/other to src/other/ext
    
    src/other/ext is intended to hold copies of third party dependencies that
    meet the following criteria:
    
    a) Upstream is active
    b) It is plausible that we can use an unaltered system install of the
       upstream dependency for our needs.
    
    Only those deps which fail to satisfy one or both of those criteria are
    stored directly in src/other.  Eigen satisfies the criteria, so shift it
    down into ext.

    Replace -idn search opt with more general -matrix
    
    Per suggestion from Sean, replace the -idn option (which was limited to
    identity matrices) with a more general -matrix filter.  IDN is supported
    as a way to specify the identity matrix ("-idn" is now "-matrix IDN")
    but the new logic also allows specification of a full 16 number matrix
    as an alternative.

    VCS has tinygl patch - remove from working tree.

    Stash work on testing tinygl as a libdm backend.
    
    Didn't take this all the way to working, but got far enough to see that
    tinygl doesn't have all the pieces our current libdm OpenGL code is
    using.  We could undoubtedly get it there if need be, by grabbing the
    pieces we need from osmesa, but seeing as osmesa is working and gives us
    a more complete OpenGL stack it's probably the way to go.
    
    Stashing work done so far on tinygl as a patch - if we decide at some
    point we want to give tinygl another look, this commit will preserve the
    initial steps taken.

    Add a regression check for src/other license files
    
    Our main regress-licenses test is focused on checking source files in
    the distribution itself for copyright and corresponding license info,
    when we have embedded logic from other projects.  This commit adds a
    second, much simpler check that simply verifies that each src/other
    distribution item (identified by a .dist file) has a corresponding
    license file in doc/legal/other, and vice versa.  It doesn't introspect
    any files the way we do with our primary source tree, but it will catch
    us if we add a new 3rd party component to src/other and forget to add
    its license to doc/legal/other.

    More thinking about QgModel
    
    I'm beginning to wonder if we might end up doing most of the QgInstance
    work in the per-object callbacks, rather than the nref updating.  We'll
    still need the latter for tops updating, most likely (since it's only
    after that function is run that we know the correct tops answers) and it
    may still be the most convenient way to do the initial QgInstance
    population when opening the database for the first time, but once
    populated the QgInstances are local to individual comb trees and will
    (for the most part) only change if their comb does.  The exception is
    valid comb instances becoming invalid or vice versa if objects are
    added/ deleted, but there too the nref tree isn't really necessary.

    If we're in script mode, wait for subprocesses to finish up before we
    quit MGED.

    Feeding a full path to ged_exec will work, but generates a GED_UNKNOWN return code since the full path doesn't correspond to a GED command name.  This is fine, except we were checking for any non-zero return from ged_tire and considering it an error, so the output file got deleted.  Check instead if the return code has GED_ERROR set.

    checkout or commit so it's safer to have this file in place.

    Update fastgen regression LF/CRLF test handling
    
    fast4 files classify as text files to VCS, so their line endings get
    updated on checkout.  Normally this won't matter, but this particular
    regression test is intended to make sure that it in fact does *not*
    matter.  For that, we need to preserve the LF (UNIX) or CLRF (DOS) line
    endings in the files upon checkout.
    
    Rather than use .gitattributes (which invite mishaps if pattern matches
    produce unintentional matches elsewhere in the tree or get stale as
    files change) we instead compress the LF and CRLF versions of the files
    to be checked out as tbz2 archives.  They are then decompressed when
    needed.  We can do this since CMake itself is able to do the
    decompression, and we are guaranteed to have CMake on any platform where
    building is possible in the first place.
    
    As an extra check, the regression script also verifies that the LF and
    CRLF versions of the input are in fact different after being unpacked.

    Note the last pre-cherrypicking commit to RELEASE
    
    Not really sure where to put this yet, or even if it is truly necessary,
    but we will need to do a cherry-pick patch release to pull some main
    changes into RELEASE without a full merge, and I'm seeing warnings that
    this will complicate eventual full merges of main into release.
    
    To make sure it's clear where the cherry picking process started, make
    an explicit record of the last RELEASE commit made prior to the start of
    the process.

    Add more notes about QgModel setup.
    
    The generality of the comb structures is going to make this a challenge,
    since there's nothing in a data sense preventing combs from including
    multiple duplicate members.  Indeed, if that happens we would really
    want the GUI to be able to display it intelligently, since that would
    offer one way for the user to correct the situation.  Unfortunately,
    that is likely to seriously complicate the behind the scenes logic for
    the model...

    Switch from db_i to ged for model db info
    
    I think we're going to want to move some methods currently defined on
    the Qt cad app down to the QgModel, like ged command execution, since
    they have a lot of implications for model management.  (Not to mention
    it would help a lot if we ever want to have multiple .g files open in a
    single app...)

    Add callback for use with db_update_nref
    
    The struct directory pointer contains much of the information we need
    for interfaces, but it has no knowledge of parent child relationships.
    Rather than the initial QtCADTree solution of (re)creating the logic to
    discover those relationships, set up to piggyback off of the work we're
    already having to do anyway with db_update_nref.
    
    db_update_nref must be called to ensure d_nref counts in the directory
    structs are correct after edits are made to the hierarchy, but (at the
    moment) ALL it does is update those reference counts - it does not
    retain any of the parent/child knowledge it must unpack in order to
    update those counts.
    
    However, that information IS present in the db_update_nref logic when
    the counts are updated.  We take advantage of that by adding a callback
    to be invoked at the points where incrementing takes place - it is a
    those points a parent/child relationship has been identified.  The
    application can thus make whatever arrangements it needs to make, and
    the only cracking of the internal comb structure done (as well as
    db_lookup for the children) is the one that had to be done anyway for
    db_udpate_nref.
    
    This is just the parent/child directory pointers - we may also want to
    pass back a pointer to the tr_l.tl_name string, since a hierarchy
    display may want to show the name even if the dp does not exist...

    Stub in a skeleton for a Qt .g model for editing
    
    When the original QtCADTree model was put together, we didn't add the
    complexity of needing to edit the model in response to edits, either
    from the view or from the .g file (beyond completely rebuilding it from
    scratch.)  Even without that factor, the resulting code was fairly
    complicated.  (Much of that complexity is inherent to the problem, but
    even so we may be able to do better in a second pass...)
    
    This stubs in an empty framework for another attempt at building a
    QAbstractItemModel for a .g file, this time with an eye towards also
    supporting editing down the road.

    Start working on a way to calculate vZ values
    
    We need some way to set data_vZ to something physically meaningful in
    the scene.  One logical candidate is to base it on closest and furthest
    points in existing scene scene objects.
    
    This function takes a scene object, iterates over its vlist, and finds
    either the closest or furthest point to the view plane.  That point is
    then used as the basis for a data_vZ value.
    
    Should also add a way to do this for an arbitrarily specified x,y,z
    point in space.

    Stash early thoughts on db tree status check
    
    We need a way for the tree view to know when it needs to update (and how
    to update without losing open state, but that's another question).  In
    principle we should be able to detect this from the db_i itself, but
    doing it without prohibitive cost may be tricky.
    
    This code is a start, but will crash because the updated dbip and the
    stored internals in the tree model will be out of sync.  Ideally we
    wouldn't have to store the internals, but as the tree state lives in the
    comb trees we need some reasonably performant way to get at it.
    
    Will need to revisit the tree model/view with fresh eyes to think about
    how best to represent what we will need here.

    Fixes for import polygon handling and naming.
    
    The polygon update routine does too much when reading a sketch if we
    assign the circle/square/etc. types, so just call the vlist update
    instead.  Also, pointers to QString data aren't stable - make a
    copy immediately if we need to refer to it later.
    
    The view we calculate may not correspond to the original polygon
    creation view, so preferentially stash and restore the original view
    using the attributes.  This allows for a viewsnap operation on a
    polygon imported from a sketch, if the sketch was originally created by
    the polygon export routine.

    Both creation and modification will need to set some of the same values,
    so it makes sense to define a common widget that can be used by both.
    Creation doesn't currently use signals, since all applications of the
    settings are associated with events, but when we get to modification
    that will change.

    Checkpoint work on splitting mod into its own tool
    
    I think there is a better way to go about this, or at least a less
    dangerous way.  What we need is for the polygon list to be updated every
    time we select the mod tool.  Right now we're triggering on a signal
    from the app's gui view update slot, which is in turn passed back down
    to the elements.  This approach functions, but has a lot of potential
    for problems - if any of the element slots that get called by that
    signal in turn change the view, that will generate another gui view
    change, and so on - hello infinite loop.
    
    Another possibility might be to introduce a signal at the QToolPalette
    level that is provided to the element when it is unhidden.  That would
    be local, without the dangerous interconnections this approach entails.
    That's the next experiment, but stashing this anyway so we can refer to
    it if needed - however dangerous it may be, it does function.

    go ahead and disable it, at least the underlying support will be there
    if we do want/need it.

    Stash some early thoughts on fully custom views
    
    Sketch editor (and any similar GUI elements) will need to supplant the
    standard view temporarily with custom drawing.  Rough in a way to do
    this, although it will be a while before we get to actually porting the
    sketch editor to figure out how to make this work for real.  (It's not
    needed for polygons, which use custom interactions in a standard BRL-CAD
    scene view.)

commit dfce5748df4fdc00cdcafffb2baaa662c7dc39e2

Date:   Sun Jun 13 11:21:21 2021 -0400

    Start thinking about view/tool interactions.
    
    So far the way the mouse interacts with the view has not changed as a
    consequence of tool selection.  That's going to need to change for the
    more advanced tools.  View polygon interactions are a case in point, and
    will serve as the test case.
    
    Initial thought is that the QToolPaletteElement will supply an event
    filter, whose job will be to in turn call a function (if supplied by the
    tool internals to QToolPaletteElement) that does the necessary event
    handling specific to the tool behavior.  That event filter will then be
    installed on (and removed from) the view (or views in quad mode) every
    time the tool selections or active tool palettes change.  We may want to
    also support the "Esc" key always clearing the view filter.
    
    (The CADApp::tree_update slot may want to become CADAPP::palette_update
    instead to handle both tree display and view event filter updates.  When
    switching between palette buttons we won't be triggering that callback
    and will need to adjust the view filter in response to the palette
    element toggling (needs thought), but when we're switching from one
    palette to another (i.e. view to instance edit) then we won't
    necessarily have an internal palette event to make the change.)

    Quiet checkbox signal emits when syncing to view
    
    Whoops - when programmatically setting checkboxes, don't emit the view
    updating signals - this is not user action in the GUI, and we don't want
    it registering as such.
    
    Manifested in a weird error setting framebuffer to overlay mode - the
    first checkbox setting (fb on) triggered a view update based on the
    checkbox signal, which then updated the view using the existing settings
    (no overlay flag set) and stomped the value supplied to the original
    view command. Doh.
    
    The fix is to block signals while we're syncing the GUI elements to
    reflect the bview state.  This is a good lesson for future work of this
    type - if manipulating GUI elements to reflect application state, be
    careful to disable signals that are intended to update the view state.
    In the GUI updating scenario we already have the view state, and don't
    want it changed.
    
    This also illustrates the utility of being able to track through these
    issues in gdb - breakpoints were a big help in figuring out what was
    happening here.

    Better - still causing a scrollbar reset in the view control, but only when we first select the control - subsequent clicks will work.  Fundamental issue still present, but not manifesting on every click.  Also doing less update work.

    First successful updating of view from palette
    
    Still pretty rough, and the event filter used to update tree
    highlighting is interfering with the mouse interactions in the palette,
    but using this we can enable and disable faceplate elements in the view
    using checkboxes in a palette control widget.

    Checkpoint a functional plugin load
    
    This is a bit cheap and probably not the right long term solution, but
    it does function so checkpointing.  Basically we turn the qged logic
    into a library, which can be linked by plugins so they know what they
    need to know about the application structures in order to hook in to
    palettes, signals/slots, etc.
    
    The "right" way is probably to recast all of this in terms of Qt's
    plugin infrastructure, but it's not clear yet how much work that is:

    Refactor brlman to ready it for a Qt mode
    
    Rather than implement another copy of the man page viewer logic, see if
    we can instead mod brlman to support a Qt display in addition to its
    command line and Tk modes.  Eventually the Qt mode should replace the
    Tk version, and if Qt is enabled the Tk mode will be disabled.
    
    This commit just sets the stage for Qt GUI work, and doesn't yet include
    the interface.

    Go ahead and commit this so I don't do it accidentally - this Qt them
    seems to do a decent job of setting up our interface with dark colors.

    Make some adjustments to qged drawing/sizing

commit 6ae9df6155abf60395532194077fef12652f6911

    Replace QAccordion with better use of QDockWidget
    
    It turns out QDockWidget has more power than I was originally expecting,
    and the behavior I was originally looking for from the accordion widget
    can actually be improved upon if we regard each tool palette as its own
    dock window.  This gives us resizing, enable/disable via the dock
    mechanisms, detachable individual palettes, and even a tabbed docking
    feature.  As long as it holds up cross platform, this looks like the way
    to go.

    Need another design run at QAccordionWidget
    
    What's there isn't behaving when we do things like make the window
    large, and some of the internal widget resizing is bizarre. Need to take
    a step back on this widget and reconsider the behavior we need.  Might
    be better to do something like make a QWidget containing a QGridLayout
    and roll our own behavior rather than trying to shoehorn QSplitter into
    doing this.  QSplitter's widget resizing behavior isn't exactly what
    we need for this case (close, but we want to relocate widgets down the
    stack rather than resize the one immediately below the spacer being
    moved...)

    More experimenting with QTreeView settings
    
    Unless we're going to display other columns we don't need the header,
    but if we hide it the line wrapping behavior of the item drawing is
    strange.  Set its height to 1 pixel, so we still get the correct
    horizontal scrolling behavior.
    
    Add a layout changed emit to the resizing - this seems to be enough to
    trigger the horizontal scrollbar update even when we haven't selected a
    tree item.

    Start working on wireframe and rt_db_internal
    
    This logic will undoubtedly evolve quite a bit, but my initial thought
    is that we should be using the edit logic for these operations, the only
    difference being we won't be getting and putting the internal from the
    .g file.  That suggests a refactor of edit.c is in order.
    
    Probably will need to shelve this for the moment, as the immediate
    purpose doesn't require interactive editing and tangling with edit is a
    non-trivial exercise, but in the long run one unified framework for the
    edit command and interactive view editing will be worthwhile.

    Start looking at setting up view names
    
    If we're going to manipulate specific views from the ged command line,
    we'll need names to be set.  Need a ged level routine for this to check
    the uniqueness of the name, but for now start simple.

    Relocate view settings into separate container
    
    Looking to make it easier to migrate view settings from one view to
    another (immediate use case is switching selection around in quad
    view.)  This moves the non-camera settings into a container, which may
    either use a local version or be overridden by an application supplied
    set.

    Put back the refactor, but using RTG.rtg_vlfree
    
    Most of the reverted changes made should still be useful - removing RT_*
    calls in favor of more explicit calls, using variables instead of
    explicit RTG.rtg_vlfree references, passing vlfree as a parameter to
    various plotting routines.  Those changes we can preserve, just using
    RTG.rtg_vlfree as the source for vlfree rather than trying to pass the
    bu_list pointer down from parent containers.
    
    We still eventually need to do the latter to remove the global, but even
    though that full removal will take more effort than we were able to
    apply in this set of changes they are still a step in the right
    direction.

    Given MGED's globals it's hard to know what the possible states are, so
    just check before we use the dbip vlfree.
    
    predictor needs more study, but I'm wondering if that might be a
    view-only construct that could be pushed down into libbv...

    Checkpoint work towards removing RTG.rtg_vlfree
    
    Studying the vlfree logic, it looks like we may be able to replace most
    of the RTG.rtg_vlfree global instances with a list associated with the
    database instance.  db_open and db_close can then take care of work that
    otherwise the calling code had to know to do (the infamous
    BU_VLS_INIT(&RTG.rtg_vlfree) needed for working drawing/plotting
    routines.)  This commit doesn't get rid of all rtg_vlfree uses in the
    code, but it should be a significant step in that direction.
    
    Need to look to see if we have any situations where drawing routines are
    looking to use RTG.rtg_vlfree without an open dbip.  If so we'll need have
    those cases use the view's vlfree list instead.

    Make a stab a wrapping QtGL and QtSW in one widget
    
    Up until now our sample app has been manually manipulating either a
    system OpenGL based widget or the software rasterizing widget.  Ideally
    that's a low level detail for application code, so see if we can
    encapsulate both in a common higher level viewing widget.
    
    Also noticed a problem which doesn't appear to be specific to this
    wrapper - when embedded framebuffer is enabled, the scene isn't
    correctly handling resizing.

    Proof-of-principle libpkg processing of Qt data
    
    Use Qt's server and connection handling, but do the libpkg processing of
    that data.  pkg_getclient and pkg_suckin don't seem to like the Qt
    communications setup - need to use the QTcpSocket read method.  Do what
    the Tcl_Channel Win32 solution did; prepare the necessary inputs
    manually from the Qt data so libpkg can proceed with standard
    unpacking and callback processing.

    Sigh.  Need to go back to basics and figure out fundamentally how Qt's

    together, before I'll be able to figure out the framebuffer
    communications.

    Report from user that a script doing a raytrace wasn't producing a file.
    Sean suspected that MGED was quitting too early and killing the
    processes run by the script, it looks like that was correct.
    
    If we're in script mode, wait for subprocesses to finish up before we
    quit MGED.

    In this form, the libpkg stdio test isn't going to work on Windows.  The
    I/O mechanisms on that platform are too fundamentally different.
    
    May be worth thinking about whether defining a way to provide
    alternative functions at various points in the pkg logic flow might
    generalize it to different forms of IPC...

    Breaking on rt, it is waiting for a response from the client handler (which we're not generating because we're not using the Tcl event loop.)  That suggests the stage is set, and it's now time to dig in to how to make this work using Qt event constructs.

    Start trying to wire up Tcl based fbserv in Qt
    
    Before we try the Qt version of this, let's see if we can get the
    existing Tcl version working more or less the way it works in Archer.
    This gets as far as launching things, but communication doesn't work.
    Note that this won't work on Windows regardless, since we're not
    providing the interp to the data structures.

    Revert the fbserv push to the backends.  The communication channels are event based, which must come from the appliation not from libraries.  The better course of action here is probably to have these hooks supplied by the application into gedp, and from there applied to individual fbserv objects.

    Refactor libtclcad fbserv down into libdm
    
    Next incremental step is to get existing fbserv mechanism working for
    rt rendering in qtgl dm's embedded fb.  To set the stage for figuring
    out how to do that, take the libtclcad version of the fbserv logic and
    abstract the Tcl specific portions into callback functions.  This does
    three things:  1)  allows us to avoid duplicating shared logic 2) makes
    it clear which portions of this do currently need Tcl, and 3) makes the
    logical flow of the event-based listening mechanisms clearer.
    
    We are going to have to in some fashion replace the Tcl listeners with
    Qt equivalents - this should make it clearer what specifically we need
    to accomplish with those equivalents.

    Queue the before-prompt printing from a subprocess
    
    The insertion methods that work are also slow, so rather than doing it
    every time we get a notification of output we throttle based on timing.
    Every 10th of a second, write all accumulated output - otherwise, add
    it to an internal QString for later printing.
    
    Because we finalize the subprocess logic already post-listener shutdown,
    use the same mechanism to also make sure any queued-but-unprinted text
    is written out at the end of the subprocess cycle.

    Have the last process listener do cleanup
    
    Restructure the cleanup callbacks slightly.  We key off of the value -1
    (which is not a valid I/O channel type) to do the final cleanup, and
    have that call made by the console's listener cleanup routine.  That
    routine checks for listeners related to the process, and doesn't do the
    final call unless all of the other listeners related to that process are
    also removed.

    These happened after the raytracing window was closed, and the notifier

    the correct answer, but so far even removing the warning suppression the

    Add fb mode to hash.
    
    Noticed it to an extent with the standalone view, but the debug messages
    make it obvious in qdm - something about the fb drawing is causing
    continual Qt events to be triggered.  I thought maybe it was something
    about how I had set up the stand-alone window, but it also happens in
    qdm which does not have the issue until fb drawing is enabled.  Will
    need to figure out what the deal is there.
    
    Would still prefer to get a texture based visualization going for the
    fb... tie visual in isst proves it is possible, just need to figure out
    the details.

    The TIG (Terminal-Independent Graphics) plotting routines in plot3.h and

    them into a subdirectory and a separate header to make it easier to
    understand which logic constitutes the "main" plot3 logic used by the
    majority of BRL-CAD's code.

    Rough in an irect subcommand for view faceplate
    
    The interactive rectangle and angle-distance cursor are both faceplate
    elements in that they are defined in the HUD (Head-Up Display), but they
    have their own GED commands (rect and adc) to manage them.
    
    Eventually for consistency we'll want both adc and irect subcommands
    defined, so the command structure offers consistent control over the
    view elements in an organized way.  The "view faceplate irect" command
    will be more focused than GED's rect - it will be up to other logic, for
    example, to utilize the rectangle dimensions for operations like
    raytracing or zooming.

    Check for pre-initialized gv_name.
    
    Need to think a bit more about what the expectations are for bview_init.
    libtclcad appears to be assuming it doesn't do any memory allocations -
    gv_name vls init is handled at commands.c:4577, before bview_init is
    called.  callbacks ptbl is also handled separately and before bview_init
    is called.
    
    In principle it would seem to be cleaner to have a bview_init and a
    corresponding bview_free that takes care of all of the internal
    container setup and tear-down...

    Shift from widget supplied view to libged supplied
    
    Upon reflection, it makes more conceptual sense for libged to be
    supplying the view structures rather than having the display widgets
    create them.  We adjust libged in one important respect for this -
    previously ged_init didn't initialize any views, but now it will
    ensure that ged_gvp always starts out with a valid view.  MGED will just
    free this view when it does its initialization (hence the adjustments to
    allow ged_free to free up a bview with no callbacks defined) but it lets
    applications getting a gedp back from ged_open immediately start using
    commands without requiring that they do additional work.
    
    This puts a little bit more responsibility on the application to inform
    the display widgets of the current data structures from its current gedp
    (as well as being sure to NULL them out when gedp is closed) but overall
    it should avoid syncing problems down the road.

    Add target_link_libraries to static for includes
    
    With the advent of imported targets in CMake building, we can't skip the
    target_link_libraries step for static builds anymore.  Include
    directories, compile definitions, etc. from those targets will be needed
    to compile the libraries.
    
    Hit this with Qt when trying to do a BRLCAD_ADDLIB build using the
    imported targets - include dirs and definitions are coming in from those
    targets that we need to successfully build.

    More work on adaptive plotting with draw2
    
    This logic attempts to be more explicit and systematic about what we're
    doing with adaptive plotting - specifically, we need some sense of view
    and size information before we produce the wireframes, which is counter
    to how autoview is normally handled (autoview looks at what is in the
    scene to generate a reasonable view.  Hence we have a classic
    chicken/egg problem.)
    
    The resolution is to use either the primitive bounding boxes (when
    available) or bounding of the non-adaptive default wireframes to
    generate initial estimates of the size, and use that information to set
    up the view the way autoview would using the vlists.  Note that final
    autoview pass should still be done the standard way to produce reliably
    visible results.  (The wireframes should usually be sized similarly to
    the primitive bounding boxes, but nothing actually guarantees that.)

    Grab some size initialization from display_list.c
    
    This sets up s_size for adaptive plotting, but I'm not convinced its the
    right way to do it.
    
    We really need to establish both primitive sizes and the basic view
    before doing the full adaptive generation (which is why draw has an
    autoview invocation in the beginning) but to get an accurate bounding
    box from the ft_bbox calls to do an autoview don't we also need to apply
    matrices in a tree walk?  May need to plot some of the steps to properly
    understand what is happening (and what needs to happen) when.

    Add a slight rework of bigE mode as draw2 -m3
    
    The current draw command's -m3 uses brep and isn't working right now,
    nor is that feature ready for prime time.  The brep command will be the
    right place to expose that feature until its much more stable and
    performant.  bigE also has its issues, but it's a classic feature of
    MGED.  All of the currently enabled shading modes also depend on working
    facetization, so it's not really a stretch in that regard.

    Yikes.  Obscure but EXTREMELY important setting that sets up some key
    OpenGL state for ambientColor and friends in dm_set_fg.  Was seeing
    geometry drawing in the scene but it was either black or using the prior
    color from previous drawing operations.
    
    Diffing the various drawing behavior state changes as reported by
    apitrace (https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace) pointed to GL_AMBIENT,
    GL_SPECULAR and GL_DIFFUSE being zero in the incorrect drawing, but set
    in the correct.  That was critical to zeroing in on the issue - a very
    useful tool to know about for this sort of debugging.

    Try to use string path comparisons early in erase2
    
    We want erase to work even if something is wonky with the struct
    directory pointers in the full path, so for the initial pruning
    operations try to use just the path strings rather than relying on
    db_fullpath creation succeeding.

    Start roughing out a grouping object
    
    As I'm working with this, I'm coming more to understand why there was a
    tiered system of display_list objects and struct solid entities.  The
    solids in isolation just can't preserve enough semantic meaning to
    preserve the original intent of a draw command through geometry
    changes.  The data I'm likely to want at a group looks like scene obj
    data (since the idea of children was introduced, at any rate) but the
    conceptual distinction is more important than I originally thought.
    
    Try to illustrate in the comment why we need bview_scene_group in
    addition to bview_scene_obj in the comments - this will manifest
    concretely when the draw2/erase2/who2 commands are updated to reflect
    the behaviors outlined here, but try to capture the initial thoughts
    where the definition lives so the reason for it is more apparent down
    the road.

    Avoid an osmesa crash involving point drawing
    
    I'd like to understand this better, but the following sequence of
    commands crashed libosmesa using an experimental view zapping feature:
    
    draw2 component
    view2 obj s1 polygon create 330 220 sq
    view2 obj s1 update 740 625
    Z -v
    view2 obj s1 polygon create 330 220 sq
    
    When s1 re-created, a[j].inputstride is 16 and vptr->stride is 0.  This
    doesn't happen without component drawn,  It does manifest for each view2
    obj manipulation of polygon shapes.  If we create a label it seems to
    clear the issue.   If we erase2 component we also don't get the issue.
    
    This may indicate there's an issue with our OpenGL state management, but
    examining the line in this function where vptr->stride is used, if start
    is zero (which is the case when we're doing this sequence) it doesn't
    matter what vptr->stride is - 0*vptr->stride == 0.  Since vptr->stride
    has no impact, we shouldn't need the assert fail in that case.
    
    This isn't fully satisfactory - if stride being zero is a problem
    elsewhere this may just be deferring the problem to further down the
    pipeline - but going ahead and committing to document that it does seem
    to improve behavior in the above test case.
    
    While this change seems to result in drawing proceeding essentially as
    expected, the point color on the s1 recreation appears to be the brown
    of component rather than yellow.  Need to check into that to see if it
    is expected, or if it is indicative of some issue that might be
    manifesting in the assert behavior we're encountering.

    WIP function to encapsulate coloring rules
    
    The rules for coloring are embedded in display_list.c and tree walking
    in librt.  We'll probably need to track this in the tree walk to avoid
    avs loading and unloading more times than needed, but even so this
    function (once complete) will be useful for two reasons:  1) it will
    allow a caller that ISN'T tree walking to get color info for a fullpath
    without having to set up a tree walk, and 2) it will serve as a concise
    and clear definition of what the actual sources and precedence are for
    object colors.
    
    Need to do some more research into current logic to ensure this function
    reflects the rules correctly, but already seems to be coloring moss.g,
    ktank.g and m35.g as expected in quick testing.

    strcmp -> bu_strcmp
    
    The logic now seems more or less able to duplicate the results of the
    standard who command.  The main difference is that the standard logic
    reports the display list entries, where this version builds the list up
    from just the displayed solid objects and doesn't need a separate
    display list.  One of the consequences is the new output will reflect
    when a toplevel model's components aren't displayed - for example,
    ktank's who2 output reflects that there are regions in the hull which
    are empty and thus can't be drawn.
    
    Need to see what the performance implications are for large models.

    Add some solid vars to the settings container
    
    Thinking on this right now is to have three levels at which these
    settings can be controlled:
    
    1.  Overall view defaults
    2.  draw command line options
    3.  Per-scene-object local overrides
    
    By default local would override global, and we could add a -f flag to
    the view command to forcefully re-apply a global change to all
    individual objects.
    
    Might want to make the bview_settings entries in view a pointer , so we
    could easily swap in a draw command version of the settings for the
    duration of a draw command and then restore the original...

    Labels don't always map 1-1 to structparse entries - stick with per-primitive approach.

    Stub in librt primitive functab entry  for labels
    
    Ew. dm_label_primitive is special casing all of the primitives to create
    labels.  This really really belongs with each primitive.  Add the slot
    (currently non-functional) to librt so we can work on setting up a
    version of this that will be cleaner.  Not planning to migrate MGED or
    libtclcad codes, so we won't be able to immediately delete
    dm_label_primitive or the MGED version, but intent is to set the stage
    for a cleaner approach in new code.

    Improve behavior of label drawing
    
    Don't return a bounding box if we can't draw the text - just draw the
    line to the label position in those cases.

    Was overthinking bbox return behavior
    
    Just pass back what fontstash gives us.  Interestingly, there is some
    sort of clamping going on (either in our code or theirs) to avoid the
    text being offscreen completely.  That's probably not what we actually
    want for this case, so will need to track down where that's coming from.
    May want to make it conditional, since there are potential uses cases
    (debugging if nothing else) but for this we want the label to stay
    associated with its specified 3D space.

    Check bbox calculation before drawing
    
    Behavior is a little odd - at the bottom of the screen the text gets
    clamped and drawn, but at the top the bbox calculation fails and the
    text disappears.  Need to double check how we're handling the bbox
    return - probably returning an error when we shouldn't be, or some such,
    and the clamping behavior is also a bit odd...  May need to validate the
    visibility of the proposed screen coordinates differently.

    Adjust how polygon editing handles view changes
    
    Generally speaking we want to alter these polygons within their original
    plane.  (For example, rotating around a polygon and then changing its
    fill line dimensions shouldn't move the polygon to the new view plane.)
    Adjust the logic accordingly, add a to_curr_view command in case we
    actually DO want to shift the polygon to a new plane.

    Upgrade Clipper library to version 6.4.2
    
    New development work is motivating using features present in newer
    versions of Clipper.  The API changed a bit, so we need to update our
    code accordingly.  This should be more extensively tested - it works for
    a simple test case, but things like hole introduction will need to be
    checked.
    
    In principle this version will tell us if a contour is open or closed
    and support operations on polylines in addition to polygons, which is
    the immediate motivation for the upgrade.  In order for the default
    state of a bg_polygon to remain closed when an array is calloced using
    the older libtclcad code, we switch the flag from a set closed flag
    (i.e. closed == 1 indicating a closed polygon) to an open flag (open ==
    0 now being the closed polygon setting, which will be the normal
    default for zero initialized arrays.

    Open/close polygons, add restore for editing view
    
    Store the contour's open/closed state at the contour level, rather than
    the polygon type.  Also, save the polygon's creation view state so we
    can restore it if the editing environment shifts.  (Right now the qdm
    autoview calling is interfering with this, but if an object is drawn
    first to short-circuit calling autoview the restore works.)

    Feeding a full path to ged_exec will work, but generates a GED_UNKNOWN return code since the full path doesn't correspond to a GED command name.  This is fine, except we were checking for any non-zero return from ged_tire and considering it an error, so the output file got deleted.  Check instead if the return code has GED_ERROR set.

    Move all Qt logic up out of swrast dm backend
    
    Just use a bview structure to pass the necessary info into the software
    rasterizer.  Once we do that, all explicit requirement for Qt disappears
    from the OSMesa based libdm backend, and it should (in principle) be
    generic to any toolkit.
    
    Accordingly, switch its name to the more generic "swrast".

    Use RGBA output from osmesa rather than RGB
    
    Grr.  Found a working path to get the painting working in Qt, but
    feeding the GL_RGB info to QImage didn't work.  Checkpointing the
    working path that has been identified, but need to consider.  Up until
    now, all the image returns have been returning RGB data with no alpha
    channel.  It may be better for consistency to do that here and manually
    prepare the input for Qt's consumption.  On the other hand, the alpha
    channel has a lot to recommend it from a usability standpoint, and
    almost certainly all environments of relevance today will be capable of
    returning it. Throwing away the information by assuming RGB output is
    also less than ideal.
    
    Options are to switch all image outputs to an RGBA output style, add a
    return type that tells the caller what they're getting, or keep
    discarding the alpha channel.

    Test QImage creation from PNG file
    
    Ugly, but this confirms it - we're not creating the QImage quite right
    from the buffer somehow.  If we read in the debugging frame file
    instead, the display is correct.  Now the question is why RGB888 isn't
    right...

    Use RGB instead of RGBA in the OSMesa context
    
    Still not the resize issue, but go ahead and match the context type
    expected by the dm-gl logic.
    
    The resize issue appears to have a pattern - four increments will jump
    it through various incorrect states back to an (apparently) correct
    state.

    Fall back on OSMesa if system OpenGL fails
    
    Yes, we can detect failure of system OpenGL and fall back on OSMesa.
    This gives us a cross platform, feature rich fallback to replace the old
    X display manager's ability to display wireframe geometry without
    OpenGL. (Note:  this Qt version is only tested so far on Linux.
    However, OSMesa has also been tried on Windows with SDL and Tk so there
    shouldn't be any insurmountable obstacles).  It will be quite slow and
    isn't suitable as a primary display method, but as a fallback this is
    looking promising.
    
    Resizing with the software render isn't quite right yet - resize states
    often don't have the drawing right once the resize stops.

    Successful display of OSMesa rendering in Qt
    
    Add the ability to the qdm test app to use either the Qt OpenGL widget
    or the OSMesa software rendering.  The latter leverages libosmesa and
    provides a stand-alone OpenGL 2.1 rendering capability that doesn't rely
    on a working system OpenGL stack.
    
    Hadn't planned on adding this yet, but my Linux box exhibited some sort
    of OpenGL problem preventing both Qt and Tk from putting up an OpenGL
    context.  Since that is precisely the situation where this capability is
    most needed it seemed worthwhile to take advantage of the inadvertent
    testing environment to get this working.  Based on debugging sessions,
    had the system OpenGL been working some aspects of this would have "just
    worked" and not been correctly set up for software rendering.  Since the
    regular context's routines fail, I can tell in this situation when the
    OSMesa routines are being called correctly.
    
    Next up is to see if auto-fallback can be arranged if the app starts up,
    tries to initialize the OpenGL context, and fails.  Ideally, we would
    fire up the software backend automatically in that situation (assuming
    we don't just crash... the way qdm is currently failing to work suggests
    we may be able to detect the situation and respond...)

    Add a version of the Qt backend that uses libosmesa rather than the
    system OpenGL.  Right now this is Qt based, but it might make more
    sense long term to make this a generic osmesa backend and just use a
    generic bview struct as the "window context".  Sort that out after we
    get it working...

    Add support for arrows to scene obj drawing
    
    This is an experiment, which enables arrow drawing generically across
    all vlist based view objects on a per-object basis.  Does the simple
    thing and iterates over the bn_vlist, adding an arrow head at the start
    of each MOVE command other than the first and at the final DRAW point.
    
    Not sure if this is sensible yet, but it has the advantage that we no
    longer require separate line and arrow types.  In theory it also makes
    it easy to do things like enabling arrows to show the direction of
    polygons, although that is untested.

    Adjust design towards callback
    
    This should in theory allow for an update pass that lets callers define
    per-object interaction routines.  Will need to pass mouse current x,y to
    the callback, and probably other changes...  thought right now is to
    have the callback return code tell libbview that the object vlist has
    changed, rather than trying to detect it explicitly.  Then a flag will
    be set in the scene obj structure, and that change will update the hash
    and trigger view updating.

    First cut at 2D view data as scene obj data
    
    If we view lines, arrows, polygons, etc. as particular types of view
    objects, the bview_scene_obj container has most of the necessary knobs
    already - we just need to enhance it to optionally store the specific
    types of information needed for these view elements.
    
    Untested and non-operational thus far - this is just working on what the
    containers should be to handle the necessary info.  In principle it
    would be better to set up both the data and any processing functions as
    pointers/callbacks to allow for fully custom view objects that are user
    defined, but I'm not sure yet what that would look like.  Right now
    libdm has specific drawing routines for arrows, polygons, etc - if those
    populate the s_vlist container of the bview_scene_obj rather than
    directly calling the dm routines we might be able to set up a fully
    generic mechanism.

    Start prototyping expansion of view obj concept
    
    If it can be managed we would prefer to subsume polygons, lines, arrows
    and labels under the bview_scene_obj umbrella as view-only objects (and
    eventually transient objects such as NIRT shotlines and rtcheck/gqa
    overlap visuals.)
    
    libtclcad is managing polygons and the rest very differently, so need to
    think about what sort of data containers we're looking for here and how
    the routines being translated from tclcad will need to adjust.  May
    prove to be too much work to be doable right now, but it feels wrong to
    have the polygons be a one-off.  If it is practical it's much easier to
    adjust this now rather than having to re-translate it again later, so
    let's give it a go.

    Start trying to create a data_polygon circle
    
    Yow.  The logic in libtclcad for adding and manipulating various kinds
    of polygons is spread over a lot of functions, some of which do part of
    the job and then serialize their data into Tcl lists to hand off to
    another function, which unpacks them from Tcl and do some more work.
    
    Rather than redo all of the libtclcad code (time consuming and error
    prone for no functional improvement), what we'll try to do instead is
    extract the essence of the logic into libbview functions for use in new
    logic going forward.

    Test out a struct directory flag indicating change
    
    The most universal indicator of potential geometry change is the lowest
    - the dbio layer.  We don't have an event system broadcasting changes
    from that level, but there may be another way.
    
    We introduce a flag in struct directory that can be zeroed by the
    calling application.  That flag is set to 1 when the lowest level of the
    API (db_put_external) performs a write.
    
    It is up to the caller to do the rest - initialize it, read it, reset it
    to zero for the next round, etc.  If the app ignores it it is harmless,
    but for change detection it is key.  That flag being set gives high level
    logic a way to detect potential changes completely independent of any
    specific GED command or library logic.
    
    A test indicates we can indeed detect an object change (in this case,
    color updating.)  Which of course leads immediately to the next problem
    - we now need to figure out how scene objects get updated after edit in
    MGED and Archer, since the color isn't updated currently in qdm in
    response to the change...

    Time the hashing to see if it is causing issues
    
    Testing with the Stanford Lucy model, it's clear that we can't hash the
    complete vlist set after every command.  It introduces a 2 second+ delay
    while the hash checks the data.
    
    I think the middle ground may be to hash the names of scene objects
    (TODO, but probably fast), count vertices in the vlists (to test), and
    have the subset of commands that can actually change vlist data without
    altering either of those metrics (i.e. a vertex edit on a BoT or moving
    a point in a point cloud) set a flag on the scene object that is cleared
    before the post-update hash is calculated (that way any setting of the
    flag will cause a view hash difference.)  Really don't want to require
    an app to have to list all GED commands with knowledge of what they
    might do - that's a headache in both libtclcad and MGED.  The GED
    command author has the domain knowledge, so they should be the ones to
    let the view know there is potential for internal vlist changes.

    In addition to not working on the Mac, this approach to the widget still
    doesn't like the libdm faceplate renderings.  Remove it for now - if

    know we have to to make a usable application.

    Rework normal/drawBegin management of HUD matrices
    
    Qt's QOpenGLWidget interacted poorly with the faceplate matrices being
    left up between the end of the drawing cycle and the next drawBegin
    call.  Also, the identified purpose for dm_normal didn't seem to be
    quite correct - it's primary job seems to be preparing the way for
    faceplate drawing, with drawBegin cleaning up after it.
    
    Change this to be a set of explicit beginning and ending functions for
    HUD (Head-Up Display) mode, and exit HUD mode once we're done with it.
    For now leaving the dm_hud_end call in drawBegin, since MGED and
    libtclcad haven't been vetted for issues and MGED at least will almost
    certainly have some.

    Checkpoint experiment with QTimer
    
    First stab at implementing the technique for update pausing from
    https://www.qtcentre.org/threads/58630-Dock-Widget-Custom-Resizing
    
    Sort of works, but doesn't reliably repaint the window.  Disabled in
    this commit as it's not working well enough, but it may be worth
    exploring combining the technique with some variant of the signal/slot
    setup of the dmglt multithreading widget to see if we can get a reliably
    responsive renderer for Mac.  Basically, the idea would be that instead
    of a render thread locking and doing the work in the OpenGL context, the
    timer would be used instead to avoid rapid expensive redraws. Then, at
    the end of the "render" wait, paintGL would be called in the main thread
    as in dmgls to actually do the work, but without the
    render-from-separate-thread logic that seems to be a problem with OSX.

    Without a render thread the center widget's OpenGL drawing has the
    potential to slow the interface, if a large enough target is being
    drawn.  If we need to run in that mode, it would be helpful to not have
    to continually re-draw if we're resizing the window or dock widgets
    within it...

    Qt is sensitive to the final OpenGL state of libdm
    
    Whee.  Trying to figure out why drawing faceplate wiped out the geometry
    wireframe, it's looking like the libdm OpenGL backends have been leaving
    the OpenGL state machine in faceplate mode and popping the matrices in
    gl_drawBegin before starting another round.  QOpenGLWidget apparently
    doesn't like that very well, and the OpenGL visual ended up clipping
    away the solid wireframes and leaving just faceplate.
    
    Some adjustments are clearly needed on the backend - this just commits
    the testing hack that got a solid wireframe and view axes up
    simultaneously.  Since we want the faceplate drawing routines to be
    backend agnostic, we may have to repackage the dm_normal and
    gl_drawBegin pieces to allow them to be applied more locally.

    Separate out functional groups for bview

Author: Clifford Yapp <238416+starseeker@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 3 14:46:25 2021 -0400

    Break bview functionality out from libdm
    
    libged isn't supposed to depend on libdm, but a couple more uses crept
    in.  libged does manipulate views and view information, so handle this
    with a separation between view concepts and display concepts.
    
    The screengrab command is more problematic, since the point is to
    capture a display rendering.  We'll leverage the new libged plugin
    architecture for that case and link just the screengrab plugin to libdm.
    
    There is potential utility in a "dm" command like that defined in MGED
    being expressed in a way easily usable by other programs, so one option
    here might be to turn the current screengrab plugin into a "dm" plugin
    which provides screengrab as one of its commands (or even as a
    subcommand of a toplevel dm command.)  The command would be a no-op if
    libged doesn't have a dmp set, and would not tie the whole of libged to
    libdm, but would allow convenient expression of display manipulation
    concepts as a reusable command.

    Move bview_scene_obj to bview.h and rm rt/solid.h
    
    Move the scene object definition down to dm/bview.h.  This sets the
    stage for shifting additional logic and the concept of scene object
    drawing/management lower in the library stack, now that we're no longer
    bound to stay at or above librt by the db_fullpath entry.  Also hoping
    to make the idea of scene objects more generic than just db solids, to
    open up managing view object in the scene as something other than
    cryptic temp database objects...

    Manage s_fullpath as user data
    
    The only librt data type active here appears to be the db_fullpath.
    Rather than making it an intrinsic property of the scene object, have it
    be data attached to the object by higher level libraries.
    
    This will set the stage for moving this data type lower in the library
    stack.

    Enable scaling via mouse drag and wheel
    
    Moved a couple of the MGED view's scaling variables into struct bview to
    allow the generic command to process scaling the same way MGED does.  In
    this case, we end up incorporating bits of logic from both MGED and the
    libged zoom command to make a properly self-contained capability.
    
    Also shifted some bview related logic down into libdm's bview_util.c.
    It may make sense to make bview functionality a small stand-alone
    library to separate it from libdm - technically libged depends on libdm
    right now for that bview functionality, which isn't ideal.

    Rework OpenGL searching to be more general
    
    This is still a work in progress (needs some more changes and lots of
    cross platform testing) but the Qt work exposed a problem on OSX with
    how we're handling OpenGL searching.
    
    Historically, we only built with the X11 version of OpenGL on OSX, and
    so had to constrain the find_package for OpenGL to avoid the native
    OpenGL framework (which is normally what Mac packages would want.)  To
    that end we have been using a FindGL.cmake file tuned to that specific
    need.
    
    However, when enabling Qt OpenGL applications on OSX, we're back to
    wanting (needing, actually) the native OpenGL framework.  There will
    probably be some work to get the Qt code working with the system
    framework, but before we get to that point we need a way to pinpoint
    which OpenGL library we need for which part of the code.  A global
    solution will no longer work.
    
    To that end, the FindGL logic focused on the X11 OpenGL libraries has
    been relocated to src/libdm/glx and trimmed down for its specific
    purpose.  Its results variables have been prefixed with an "X" to avoid
    colliding with the standard OpenGL search results.
    
    A more standard FindOpenGL.cmake replaces the FindGL.cmake file for
    scenarios where we want to use those libraries.  Need to figure out how
    to handle libdmgl in this context - probably need to build dm-gl.c into
    the ogl backend rather than linking libdmgl so we don't end up trying to
    mix X11 and Apple OpenGL libraries...
    
    While we're at it, move the OpenGL specific bits from dm_util into
    libdmgl.

    Implement both single and rendering thread dmGL
    
    For testing purposes, provide all-up implementations of dmGL both with
    the rendering thread approach and with a paintGL override.  It's looking
    like we can't mix the two in one widget.
    
    Thus far, the rendering thread approach doesn't seem to work on the
    Mac.  This particular iteration is unlikely to change that.  We'll see
    about the single threaded version...

    Qt on OSX is going to need native OpenGL
    
    OSX (unsurprisingly) is presenting issues.  First one is making sure we
    find the right OpenGL to use with Qt - that means not mixing X11 and
    Native OpenGL, which is going to be a problem for non-Aqua Tk, but
    that's a problem for later...
    
    More concerning is the qdm demo isn't displaying, even when we get the
    libraries lined up.  The widget is present, since we're getting
    printouts from mouse events, but the wireframe isn't being drawn...

    First translation of mouse view updating from MGED
    
    Start unwinding MGED's interpretation of mouse motions - it does a lot
    of different things depending on its mode.  We don't want modal
    interfaces, but we're probably still going to need most of the mouse
    behaviors to realize the same interface features.
    
    The eventual idea is to translate the "post X,Y delta" calculations on
    the bview into utility routines that are application and toolkit
    agnostic.  This test implements view centered rotation of the view
    within the camera.

    Add a context parameter to dm_open
    
    Historically, dm_open took a Tcl interp pointer and deduced from the
    Tcl/Tk context whether it needed a new window or not.  When operating
    (potentially, not necessarily) without a Tcl/Tk interp, we need another
    way to tell if we are being given an existing context or if we need to
    create one.  With the ctx paramater, we can tell.

    In principle this logic should be reusable across ogl, wgl, qtgl, and
    any other backends doing raw OpenGL drawing.  Even if that doesn't work
    in practice, pieces of it should be usable and specific per-backend
    functions can be implemented on an as needed basis.

    Start following a mouse event through MGED
    
    MGED has very good mouse updating behavior for its scenes, which we want
    to capture in any new interfaces.  The logic that controls this is
    somewhat complex, so to start we will follow a single event through from
    its X,Y motion initial through to the final matrix generation
    application.  That will roughly identify the logic we need to translate
    from MGED into a Qt widget (and ideally encapsulate into something more
    generically reusable... right now MGED's logic is tied up with Tcl
    commands...)

    Opaque resizing seems to work better.
    
    When moving the QSplitter up and down, was getting occasional crashes of
    the form "Cannot make QOpenGLContext current in a different thread".
    This is similar to problems encountered with Tk in rtwizard - opaque
    resizing (where the window is continually redrawn as it is resized)
    doesn't work so well for the OpenGL drawing context.
    
    Fortunately, the same solution is available - just postpone the redraw
    of the window contents until the user releases the splitter.

    Base drawing updates on bview changes
    
    Obviously not enough (needs display list check as well at a minimum, and
    when mouse/keyboard are enabled that'll be another potential source of
    change events) but demonstrates in principle the idea of hashing the
    view state to detect when commands have altered it.

    Experiment with creating a hash of bview
    
    If it proves practical, a better solution than storing full copies of
    the previous view state would be to create a hash.  The application can
    then just store the previous view hash, and after command execution
    check the new hash against the old to see if we need to draw.
    
    This compiles, but isn't yet tested to see if it hashes correctly.

    potentially know if a redraw is needed regardless of the details of the
    command.

    Merge additional extbuild changes into main.
    
    After the revert of the first merge revert, we can now merge in the
    updates from extbuild.
    
    Broadly, the changes correct a couple missing RPATH adjustment cases and
    correcting a few paths set.  We also improve the robustness of the final
    RPATH setting step on non-OSX platforms by using patchelf for those
    platforms the same way we use otool on OSX.  Hopefully CMake itself will
    eventually be able to do the necessary steps natively, but in the
    meantime this does the job.

    Switch to using tclsh for pkgIndex generation
    
    btclsh will attempt to use the generated pkgIndex files, and in a
    parallel compilation it is possible for one of the files to be in an
    intermediate state when btclsh tries to run to launch another one.  Use
    tclsh here instead, since it won't try to load any of the files being
    generated.

    Move chrpath to src/other/ext
    
    If we're going to use chrpath, we need awareness of it before we start
    defining the ext build targets.

    Explain the reason for chrpath usage.
    
    It's probably worth more study, but the odd library runpath in the
    installed libgdal.so is originating from the GDAL build itself.  So far
    it's looking like that path set is a consequence of what CMake is doing
    internally to track RPATHs, and I've not yet identified a combination of
    CMAKE_*RPATH* settings that avoids it.
    
    We're getting the following from the GDAL_BLD ExternalProject_Add
    installed version of the lib:
    
    Library runpath: [/home/user/brlcad/build/lib::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::/home/user/brlcad/build/lib]
    
    when we should be getting (and are getting, prior to the GDAL_BLD install step):
    
    Library runpath: [/home/user/brlcad/build/lib::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::]
    
    Then, when the parent CMake build does its install, the first part of
    the path is overwritten but the appended path from GDAL_BLD persists.
    The resulting binaries will run, but is an untidy state in which to
    leave the runpaths.
    
    I've not found a way yet using vanilla CMake to scrub down the final
    results to what we want - simply ensuring chrpath is available to do the
    job instead seems to be simpler all around.  (Only tested on Ubuntu
    Linux so far - needs testing on the BSDs as well.)

    Stash build of chrpath utility
    
    Not 100% sure yet we'll need this - the problem may lie in how the
    subbuilds are doing their RPATH setups - but since this is a working
    setup go ahead and store it in case we do need it.

    Identify the basic issues with ExtProject_Target
    
    Three remaining issues surfaced with the RPATH setting - two minor, one
    trickier.
    
    Minor #1 - Itcl and Itk didn't have the RPATH flag set in their target
    definitions (fixed).
    
    Minor #2 - 3rd party binaries RPATHs don't match those produced by the
    main CMake build - using bin instead of lib (investigating).
    
    More significant is the behavior of CMake's RPATH_CHANGE - it is
    correctly setting the final path, but it is not clearing the build dir
    path.  So far I've not found a way to make the available commands in
    CMake do the job, so I'm falling back on a solution similar to that
    necessary on Apple and using the chrpath utility.  The code in this
    commit works if a system chrpath is present - we'll need to bundle a
    version in misc/tools to make sure we have the capabilities we need
    reliably.  (chrpath is GPL, so we can't install it or use it as anything
    except a build tool - unfortunately I've not found a BSD/MIT licensed
    tool for this type of rpath work...)

    Merge new system of 3rd party building into main.
    
    This replaces our old method of managing 3rd party dependencies (which
    required a CMake build system for every third party dependency and often
    entailed significant work on the 3rd party build systems) with a new
    approach.  In this implementation, we use ExternalProject_Add with the
    3rd party build systems provided by the original upstream projects.
    
    Typically when ExternalProject_Add is used in a CMake project, the
    "superbuild" pattern must be used - i.e., both the third party
    dependencies and the primary project must be managed by a separate
    parent project whose job is to ensure that the various independent
    projects are built in the correct order.  This is necessary because the
    primary project's CMake build has no detailed knowledge of the build
    outputs of the ExternalProject_Add build targets, and (for example) has
    no way to know that it should hold off building library object files
    that require a generated header from the ExternalProject_Add outputs.
    
    BRL-CAD avoids this issue by introducing a second stage to the
    ExternalProject_Add build.  The configure, build and install stages for
    the third party libs are managed by ExternalProject_Add, but BRL-CAD's
    logic defines a list of explicit outputs generated by those projects.
    Those lists are used to incorporate the necessary outputs into BRL-CAD's
    package generation for binary installers, but those lists also allow our
    logic to define a second layer of build targets.  The output files are
    set up to depend on the ExternalProject_Add completion, and then a new
    custom build target is defined that depends on the explicitly listed
    output files.  BRL-CAD consumers of the 3rd party libraries then depend
    on the custom target that depends on the explicit output list.
    
    This approach allows us to treat the outputs of the 3rd party builds the
    same way CMake handles files such as generated headers within its own
    builds, and preserve the necessary build ordering to allow object
    building to wait for necessary 3rd party outputs to become available.
    The advantages are:
    
    1.  Use (with occasional mods to support CMake RPath manipulation) the
    native build systems provided by 3rd party dependencies, instead of
    having to create and maintain our own CMake build systems.
    
    2.  Configure steps for the third party libraries are performed as part
    of the overall build step for BRL-CAD, which means they can execute in
    parallel and the initial configure stage is shorter.
    
    3.  In principle, this approach allows for bundling of pre-compiled
    libraries with BRL-CAD binary installers - i.e., developers will be able
    to build the 3rd party libraries once, specify a specific search path
    for subsequent builds, and get bundled packages with minimal
    recompiling.

    Document exec files in SVN history
    
    It was found when attempting to perform distcheck on a Git checkout of
    the rel-7-32-2 tag that not all files had preserved their executable
    properties during the translation.  This manifested in a distcheck
    failure where the run.sh script for benchmark, when copied to
    bin/benchmark, failed to run.
    
    To correct this issue, a repowork feature was added (see
    https://github.com/BRL-CAD/repowork/commit/5f0cd70e0a2e2de153337bed87ae)
    to update the modes of specified paths globally throughout the history,
    and a list of SVN paths that at some point in the repository history had
    been executables was generated.  Since this list (svn_exec_all.txt)
    included a fair number of files with the flag accidentally set, Sean
    audited the list and produced a smaller target set (svn_exec_final.txt).
    Those paths were then set executable throughout the Git history, to
    ensure they would run as expected if checked out.
    
    This is something of a brute force solution in that it does not capture
    at what points in the SVN history these flags were set or unset on
    various files, but the cost of trying to more precisely identify and set
    the executable mode in that fashion was deemed too high - setting the
    flags globally for these paths addresses the functional issue, and was
    relatively straightforward to achieve.

    Stash the git conversion tkhtml repair scripts
    
    The original git conversion of BRL-CAD deliberately removed most of the
    expanded RCS tags from its source files, in order to make git's diff and
    history tracking as efficient as possible.  However, it was missed that
    the tkhtml build was actually aware of these populated tags and would
    not compile without them.  This resulted in a situation where historical
    checkouts would not compile due to tkhtml's not having its RCS tags,
    even though the original forms of the trees would have compiled.
    
    There were a couple of possible workarounds for this.  Git itself can
    populate the $Id$ RCS tag, which happened to be the tag at issue -
    although its output is nothing like other tools, it suffices to achieve
    compilable sources.  This can be set up with a single line run from the
    top level brlcad checkout:
    
    echo "/src/other/tkhtml/** ident" > .git/info/attributes
    
    A second option was to manually provide a workable change to the sources
    after checkout:
    
    find . -path \*tkhtml\* -type f -exec sed -i 's/\$Id\$/\$Id: tkhtml\$/g' {} \;
    
    In the end, however, we found a way to correct the repository history
    directly.  The scripts being committed here, along with a new option
    added to the repowork tool (now being stored it its own github repo)
    were used to generate fast-import files representing the original state
    of the files in SVN, and alter the data in the repository by mapping the
    old Git tkhtml file references to the SHA1 signatures of the SVN
    versions.  As long as the blob fast-import file is loaded first into the
    target repository so the blobs are there to reference, the fast-import
    file written by repowork can successfully import and reference the
    the original SVN files.

    Update fastgen regression LF/CRLF test handling
    
    fast4 files classify as text files to VCS, so their line endings get
    updated on checkout.  Normally this won't matter, but this particular
    regression test is intended to make sure that it in fact does *not*
    matter.  For that, we need to preserve the LF (UNIX) or CLRF (DOS) line
    endings in the files upon checkout.
    
    Rather than use .gitattributes (which invite mishaps if pattern matches
    produce unintentional matches elsewhere in the tree or get stale as
    files change) we instead compress the LF and CRLF versions of the files
    to be checked out as tbz2 archives.  They are then decompressed when
    needed.  We can do this since CMake itself is able to do the
    decompression, and we are guaranteed to have CMake on any platform where
    building is possible in the first place.
    
    As an extra check, the regression script also verifies that the LF and
    CRLF versions of the input are in fact different after being unpacked.

    Remove r62027 and r62028 - incorrect creation and immediate deletion of framebuffer-experiment branch in SVN.  In git conversion these are immediately followed by r62029 on the same branch, which ends up being a duplicate of r62027.

Date:   Mon Mar 1 13:19:19 2021 +0000

    Add some more utility scripts for repo comparison
    
    Having assigned SVN revisions to most of the git commits,
    that opens up another option for comparison - generating
    diff sets from multiple git SHA1 commits that should
    correspond to SVN commits, and looking for differences.
    
    In an initial trial, a little less than 10% don't generate
    matching diffs.  We've observed what appear to be occasional
    differences in how SVN and git calculate their diffs.  Since
    MD5 sum comparison only works when the diffs are exactly the
    same, the approximate matching script uses ssdeep and comm
    instead to get a sense of how different the two patches are.

    More hunting... I think some of the 'mystery' itcl commits may be coming from a CVS scriptics branch that doesn't appear to have made the translation to SVN, possibly because it looks like the scriptics branch notation/numbering in CVS may be incorrect per https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/cvs-branches.html#branchnumbers ?

    Not sure if this is going to be practical, but start hand-mapping the 600+ Git commits not otherwise mapped to SVN commits.  So far they seem to be 'pieces' of SVN commits so identifying the corresponding SVN revision they were 'broken out' from.

    Rename - test updates using script succeeded.
    
    To test the efficacy of this script, one of the updating
    files to the conversion was altered to remove one of the
    earliest correction lines, and that line was applied in
    isolation to create a new repository with most of the
    SHA1 ids altered.  The original repository and the
    altered repository were then used to update the full input
    files (minus the already applied line) by mapping the
    original SHA1 keys to the corresponding new keys.  After
    application of the altered files, the final git log --all
    log from the resulting repository was compared to the
    equivalent log generated from the repository created by
    applying the original files to the original input. The logs
    were identical, which means all the mapping were successfully
    made and the equivalent changes successfully applied.

    Grr.  The CVS branch assignments based off of git rev-list --first-parent proved unreliable - Sean noted that we can check the CVS .v files to get explicit branch information, and it looks likethe SVN assignments were correct.  I may be wrong, but it's looking like Git just conceptually does not retain this origin information at all.  Stash the set of revs->branches, so we can fix the commit messages with repowork.

    More SVN assignments for multi-branch commits.  Some of these are approximate, as the commits were broken out differently by cvs2svn and cvs-fast-export.  A few of the later cases in the 222** - 223** range are different enough that it's probably not worth sorting through.

    Start a simple Qt viewer for the isst visual.
    
    Main goal is to figure out how Qt's OpenGL widget will work
    with the texture based approach to data display.  ISST's
    visual is a working example of displaying raytracing results
    with a texture, and is also fairly self contained as far as
    the rest of the dm/fb software pipeline is concerned.
    
    Noticed also that the Tcl/Tk version of isst doesn't want to
    start, at least using a system install of Tcl/Tk on Linux.

    It doesn't show up with a pix-fb, but Qt's OpenGL widget won't allow calling makeCurrent from any thread but the main one.  At a glance, it looks like we may need to change how we're rendering the pixels to the framebuffer, possibly using the isst approach.

    Move fontstash up a level - it may get used in more than one dm backend, and there's no point particular point in multiple copies.

    Sigh.  Until qtads can deal cleanly with the non-compositing case, it's not worth the complexity.  Stick to QDockWidget for now.

    Qt Advanced Docking System doesn't work without a compositing manager running on X11 systems.  QtX11Extras offers a runtime way to detect this condition, so in principle we can detect the problem and fall back to QDockWidget.

    Uh oh.  Missed a stepcode path, and sha1 dercs map pulled in some of the step files that shouldn't be altered.  Looks like coversions after rr77841 are now problematic.  Need to see if a solution short of a full re-run can be found.

    Note work on librt timer code
    
    This is borderline - certain timing outputs may change now
    that we are making more of an effort to use the CPU timers
    when the API says we are, but it's not clear that there will
    be significant user visible implications.
    
    If timing answer change that will be potentially significant,
    so going ahead and noting in NEWS to provide some visibility.

    Avoid duplicating call to nmg_kr() in g-iges
    
    OSX is getting a crash, and valgrind on Linux reports an issue
    with db_free_tree called from g-iges.c:646 getting an invalid
    read.  The comment with that db_free_tree line indicates
    db_free_tree does an nmg_kr call, so it looks like this prior
    call in the same routine was interfering.

    We identified which change caused the regression, but not yet whether the problem is with the new semaphore system as used with gqa or with some other issue that was simply being masked by the old semaphore system.  Workaround until this is fixed is to use -P1 to generate plot files.  Bump down to next patch release.

    Make the 'look beyond the specified trees' feature optional (and non-default) so we can better match existing push behavior.  (The non-locality feature probably also has significant performance implications in large .g files, but that's currently untested.)

    Remove combtree_i structure from npush - unneeded.
    
    Was making things too complicated by assigning IDN matrices
    to dp_i instances on the way down the push tree - combs will
    need IDN matrices, but only when writing the comb instances
    in the .g file.  In the meantime, we need to keep the "current"
    matrix state in order to recognize situations where we're going
    to need to copy higher level combs with the dp_i instances.
    Once non IDN matrices are recorded rather than thrown away, we
    don't need any detailed look at the comb tree itself - the
    matrix encapsulates the uniqueness (or non-uniqueness) of the
    comb.

    Adjust GUI apps default working dir to HOME.
    
    When launched from a system installed location via icon, the default
    working directory of MGED, Archer and rtwizard gets set to the bin
    directory that holds the executable.  This is typically a read-only
    location, which results in a variety of problems when trying to run
    various commands.
    
    The most typical case where this is a problem is Windows desktop and
    start menu shortcuts.  The NSIS installer has a way to adjust the
    directory, but the MSI installer generated by WiX is a tougher nut to
    crack.  Various experiments have so far failed to identify a working
    approach to adjusting the shortcut startup directories with CMake/WiX.
    Using Windows bat files as launchers works, but using them with the
    MSI installer results in incorrect icons for the desktop shortcuts
    with no obvious way to override them.
    
    Rather than continue to jump through hoops, just set the working dir
    directly to the user's home directory when these three applications
    are invoked without arguments.  This should preserve all existing
    behaviors for any scripting cases, but will avoid a read-only working
    directory when using the no-args launch produced by desktop shortcuts.

    Experiment with an option to set working dir.
    
    Trying to get the MSI installer from WiX to change the working
    directory for shortcuts has proven challenging.  An alternative
    is to allow for the possibility of defining a shortcut that tells
    the application itself to change the working directory - untested
    as yet.

    In the two cases where we may want/need a full path to an executable that can't be deduced by libbu (external user of libs with an applicaton location not in the CAD dirs) provide versions of the functions where the caller can pass in the path, per the TODO item.  Set up deprecation so we can eventually eliminate the old form in favor of the new.

    Think the asynchronous I/O has been fixed - turned out to be an incorrect fix to a typo in the libtclcad management logic.  Added a stdout handler when it wasn't needed, which avoided a crash due to the original issue but introduced other problems.

    Removed from MGED's menu bar (unused features, can be accomplished
    another way, or should be exposed only as lower level settings when
    there are sensible defaults that seldom change):
    
    ViewRing menu and entries.
    Modes->Persistent Sweep Rectangle
    Modes->Collaborate
    Modes->Rateknobs

    Settings->Framebuffer->Rectangle Area
    
    There are others on the TODO list, but they pertain a little more
    directly to features known to be in use (lighting, display lists,
    key forwarding) so those need a little more care to be sure the
    alternative ways of managing them work and are documented - bump
    them down to the next release iteration.

    Update to latest stepcode.  Surprisingly, the tests made after clearing the various stepcode warnings but before starting any rework to avoid C4251 issues appear to result in a successful Windows build.  A closer reading of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4251 makes the language a bit more ambigous.  That page documents when C4251 may be ignored, but I had the impression ALL of the listed condtiions had to apply.  It may be that the error can be ignored if ANY of those conditions are true... that might explain why the build worked.

    Revert compatibility changes for upstream stepcode.
    
    After discussions with Sean, it's not clear these methods would be
    regarded as best practice and we may simply change upstream to
    re-expose the direct pointers.
    
    Also, rather than altering our copy, the promising results with the
    extbuild experiments suggest it is time to look at getting back in
    sync with upstream.  However, rather than doing this in extbuild
    and conflating it with those changes, the decision is to do the
    stepcode sync in a separate branch. This will allow for easier
    testing and change review.

    Get a bit more sophisticated about the Tcl package lookup.  Just having Itcl isn't enough by itself - it would be for MGED/Archer, but we may also need to build Itk against the system Itcl install.  For that we need find_package(ITCL) to succeed.  (On Ubuntu, it's the difference between having itcl3 installed and also having itcl3-dev installed.)

    Make a stab at a portable librt timer.
    
    This code attempts to replace the various librt timer* files with a
    single implementation in C++.  Insofar as we can, use standard C/C++
    functions to retrieve values.
    
    Windows presents a complication in that clock() does not return CPU
    time.  Per their documentation and examples, try to use the only
    available option on that platform to get CPU time.
    
    For elapsed time (I think this is intended to be wall clock time?)
    use C++11 chrono support which should be portable across all targeted
    platforms.
    
    This needs review - I'm not sure we were returning CPU time from the
    rt_get_timer function even on systems with a standards compliant
    clock() available previously, so this may be a behavior change even
    though it is trying to match the behavior described in rt/timer.h.

    Grr.  Windows doesn't provide CPU time with clock() - which, if I'm reading this right, means timer-nt.c is measuring the wrong thing?  rt/timer.h says the timer is supposed to be reporting CPU time...  First step is to see if we've got GetProcessTimes available.

    Backport a couple changes from upstream stepcode.
    
    In order to prepare our step converter code for updating to the latest
    upstream stepcode, we've backported a couple changes needed to make
    the current version work the way the new one will.
    
    Discovered I was testing with the wrong stepcode branch when I tried
    upgrading earlier in the extbuild branch - stepcode's master wasn't in
    a working state.  The develop branch was where updates and fixes had
    been applied.  Fixed upstream with a ff merge of develop onto master,
    and then tried again to test building step-g.
    
    A couple class data members we were directly reading that have now been
    protected in upstream classes.  Since the old code didn't have
    equivalent accessors, we add them in our fork so our converter code
    is ready to shift.
    
    We will also need to address or ignore a couple compiler warnings being
    tripped by the newer stepcode generated output.  Prefer to fix the
    generated code upstream, but not sure yet how hard it will be.
    
    Only other change spotted is an adjustment of the template that lists
    the generated STEP C++ files to add the *_unity.cc files.  They include
    all the individual entity files that are now being written.  There is
    a note that not all compilers support those files, but we will have to
    see - if we need to list individual entity files build logic will be
    uglier, since we will need pre-generated per-schema lists of cc and h
    files for CMake and we won't have any way to auto-generate them at
    CMake time out of the box.

    Not sure yet if this is practical, but see if we can abstract the platform naming of the libraries into a function based on the pattern.  If the naming is too erratic this won't work in general, but initial regex linux test works so checkpointing.

    Ignore specific directories, not just the root dir of the install.  Per CMake docs, that actually won't work - the ignore vars ignore exact dirs, not subdirs in a prefix dir.  (A bit unfortunate, in some ways, since ignoring the subtree is really our intent here, but as far as I know CMake doesn't offer such a mechanism.

commit ba927639d80a9bf12dccd20eaadd75c496f77b8a
Author: Christopher Sean Morrison <brlcad@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 30 13:35:59 2020 +0000

    add support for empty cells in formatting.
    
    this is something strtok() doesn't intrinsically support, so we augment
    behavior by looking for sequences of nulls or separators within the
    strtok-modified buffer.  strsep() does support empties, but it's not
    portably guaranteed.  the reason for implementing this is two-fold:
    first, it lets authors skip columns while printing and second, it
    avoids a bug in libfort (reported) that precludes indexing directly
    into empty cells.  this was a bit nasty to figure out and not the
    best coding to say the least, but not seeing a good way to reduce the
    complexity just yet.  it does seem to work well (at least on mac's bsd
    strtok), but does warrant portability / unit testing.

    implement the guts to bu_tbl using libfort.
    
    this implements a basic table formatting API useful for all the
    places where we currently display gridded table output.  first
    proofed by cliff in the stat command, libfort is pretty awesome
    for this purpose and will replace the other manual approach
    started in num.c (for matrix printing).  intentionally not
    exposing the breadth of libfort functionality.  this is 1) so
    libbu API symbols can be kept to a bare minimum, 2) so calling
    code can utilize similar/familiar code patterns (readability),
    and 3) so calling sites stick to a limited set of table styles
    for end-user consistency and usability.

    also, don't interleave styling commands into the printf stream.  let

    Grumble... initial testing suggests that Tcl's configure script doesn't like the wacky installation path it needs to pass to --prefix.  Pretty much means we have to disable the odd pathnames test if we're using Tcl's native build, since those paths are central to its function.  (Could run it with Tcl disabled, which I suppose would be better than nothing...  if we can get a good isolated test case set up and confirm it's a Tcl issue, might be worth an upstream bug report.)

    Problem wasn't what I thought - had to do with unwittingly employing two quoting mechanisms simultaneously.  Had surrounded paths with double quotes, but internally spaces were backslash escaped already.  Combination resulted in a non-existant path being set.

    Ugh.  Looks like file(COPY) has some odd limitations when it comes to filenames with spaces in paths - it works some of the time, but not all the time (https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21420).  Hate to do it, but may have to fall back on native tools for this until file(COPY) gets sorted.

    Revert the stepcode simplification and related converter logic changes.  Didn't change the functional issue seen with Windows+Ninja, and Sean is correct that this rework moves us significantly further from upstream.  I hate to do it in some ways - unless this refactor did in fact clash with the ISO standard, I think it did clean things up - but the better long term answer is to try and achieve something similar in the upstream code.  NOTE:  when I tried the upsteam stepcode, it did not work.  Not sure yet why.

    skip the bigdb test if we can't allocate enough memory.
    
    cmake 3.1 has a feature where a test will be considered skipped if
    there's a particular exit code.  use this to detect when the bigdb
    test is aborting due to not being able to allocate 5x the amount of
    requested memory (this is a librt issue).

    modify the test to make sure we can allocate enough.
    
    upon observing and debugging test failures on lower-memory systems,
    came to understand more specifically the cause being incredibly
    inefficient handling by librt.  debugging shows a given allocation
    passed in as title ends up creating 9 copies.  Due to how AVS are
    copied/merged/recopied as they're synced as well as how objects are
    serialized for export, there are as many as 5 copies simultaneously!
    
    In order to combat this, we test whether we can allocate in advance
    with malloc first, and halt if we can't get 5x the requested amount.

    Something isn't quite right with the build logic for header geneneration here - Windows isn't succeeding in its first pass, but does on its second.  That probably means there is some sort of dependency issue, but the error message is less than informative.  This isn't the first time this step has caused problems over the years... rather than trying to depend on a working Tcl/Tk stack for a simple quoting job, just use some basic (and self-contained) C++ to do the work.

    Got bit again by treating $<CONFIG> as an indication of multiconfig - it gets set when single config builds set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE as well.  Update accordingly.

    Generator expressions in install(CODE) is supported starting in CMake 3.14, but some of the stable Linux distros aren't shipping a version that new yet.  For the one case we're using it, force the executable we need to run to build in a predictable location and then just execute it directly from there.  Deliberately leaving the generator expression form of this commented out, because we should swap it back in as soon as we can require 3.14.

    Update Find modules to respect _ROOT variables, add dependencies on _stage targets where appropriate.  This paves the way for allowing find_package to target the specific BRL-CAD directory that holds the installed outputs of the third party external builds.  The ability of find_package to respond first to a _ROOT variable is one of the drivers for requiring newer CMake.

    switch the nirt binding from 'n' to 'S' for shoot or sample.  need to review all bindings, but this adds some safety to the invocation.  switching the key binding to requiring a modifier (i.e., shift-s) makes it less likely to be accidentally triggered which is important given neither mged or archer handle nirt's invocation gracefully / asynchronously.  encountered a hard multi-minute unresponsive lockup while spinning a nurbs model around as nirt ran prep.

    having every potential access point call init is super brittle.  void pointer is no good too.  instead, wrap the command map in a function and make it do the init check for all.  that said, we shouldn't be initializing like this.

    With the shift to plugins for ged commands, any test executables using them will need to be located in the bin dir, just like those tests that need files from the data dir, and for the same reason - we need bu_dir path lookups to work reliably, and for that we need to be able to decode the executable path to a correct relative location.  Sean noticed the bigdb_1gb test was failing when run with ctest but succeeded when run from the build dir.  Observing in debugger, bu_dir was succeeding when program was run in isolation from a working dir of the top level build dir, but failing when ctest did the launching.

    fixed mged crashing when no DMs other than nu are available.
    
    if all DMs except nu end up disabled after cmake, e.g., headless
    server compiles or no-X11 builds, mged was crashing in classic mode on
    attach prompt construction.  I made it less likely for libdm to return
    no dms and made mged handle that condition regardless for
    future-proofing.  bug that was observed by a user and myself.

    Closing multiple rt instances is crashing MGED on Windows.  Really need to defer I/O channel closure until all currently running subprocesses are terminated... in the meantime try not to do things that cause the crash.  This isn't a final solution, because I/O from any remaining running subprocesses will be lost as the first one calls the delete handlers and closes the channels.

Date:   Tue Oct 6 20:09:57 2020 +0000

    Overhaul pixcmp with modified options and new output formatting.
    
    Notably, changed -s to -q from silence to quiet, so we can add a -s
    flag for printing same value matches.  Also changed -l to -d for
    printing different bytes to be consistent.  Also added help flags.
    
    Another notable change is now those -d and -s output lines will report
    a label indicating whether the pixel or byte is matching, off-by-1,
    off-by-many, or missing as pixcmp now also handles comparing different
    size images.
    
    Cleaned up printing and usage accordingly.  Will update other docs and
    references subsequently.

    Upstream has moved quite a bit from this version of SPSR, we've added the library call to it which still isn't in upstream, and experiments with the latest PoissonRecon project code indicated it now takes a huge amount of RAM to compile out of the box.  Strip this down somewhat and move it into a subdir of libbg, since a system version is currently guaranteed not to be suitable...  No particular point in paying the third party build maintenance overhead right now.

    Merge brep-debug logic into trunk
    
    These changes are getting increasingly difficult to maintain in a
    branch.  They are not changing much at the moment, so there is little
    incentive to keep them separate in a branch. Moreover, the maintenance
    cost of doing so is becoming significant.  The branch can be made again
    when development resumes, but for the moment (since we don't want to
    lose this work) bring the files back into trunk so they are part of
    routine updates and modernization.

    This is a workaround, but if the build fails once try it a few more times before giving up.  Since a fair number of the failures seen so far are intermittent, multiple attemps may succeed instead of generating false negatives.  Switch execute_process to one call per action - per CMake docs that's the way to do sequential execution.

    Far enough along now to be interesting.  Implement a tabular stat command for reporting database object info, using https://github.com/seleznevae/libfort for table printing.  Can specify columns and sorting, as well as applying search filters to focus output.  Not sure this is a keeper, but checkpoint so progress is recorded.
