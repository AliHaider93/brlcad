    Replace -idn search opt with more general -matrix
    
    Per suggestion from Sean, replace the -idn option (which was limited to
    identity matrices) with a more general -matrix filter.  IDN is supported
    as a way to specify the identity matrix ("-idn" is now "-matrix IDN")
    but the new logic also allows specification of a full 16 number matrix
    as an alternative.

    Feeding a full path to ged_exec will work, but generates a GED_UNKNOWN return code since the full path doesn't correspond to a GED command name.  This is fine, except we were checking for any non-zero return from ged_tire and considering it an error, so the output file got deleted.  Check instead if the return code has GED_ERROR set.

    Update fastgen regression LF/CRLF test handling
    
    fast4 files classify as text files to VCS, so their line endings get
    updated on checkout.  Normally this won't matter, but this particular
    regression test is intended to make sure that it in fact does *not*
    matter.  For that, we need to preserve the LF (UNIX) or CLRF (DOS) line
    endings in the files upon checkout.
    
    Rather than use .gitattributes (which invite mishaps if pattern matches
    produce unintentional matches elsewhere in the tree or get stale as
    files change) we instead compress the LF and CRLF versions of the files
    to be checked out as tbz2 archives.  They are then decompressed when
    needed.  We can do this since CMake itself is able to do the
    decompression, and we are guaranteed to have CMake on any platform where
    building is possible in the first place.
    
    As an extra check, the regression script also verifies that the LF and
    CRLF versions of the input are in fact different after being unpacked.

    Hmm.  high_resolution_clock on BSD isn't returning the correct epoch answer.

    Note the last pre-cherrypicking commit to RELEASE
    
    Not really sure where to put this yet, or even if it is truly necessary,
    but we will need to do a cherry-pick patch release to pull some main
    changes into RELEASE without a full merge, and I'm seeing warnings that
    this will complicate eventual full merges of main into release.
    
    To make sure it's clear where the cherry picking process started, make
    an explicit record of the last RELEASE commit made prior to the start of
    the process.
