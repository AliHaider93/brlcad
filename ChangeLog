    add a -C non-classic mode flag.
    
    this essentially performs the opposite of the -c classic console mode flag.  It requests the GUI and interactivity.  note using the flag does not preclude non-GUI initialization if the command-line arguments indicate batch/scripting/redirection.

    only check if stdin is a tty.
    
    just because stdout has been redirected doesn't necessarily mean we don't want a gui or don't want to be able to type commands.  it could be that mged's output is being redirected to a file for logging purposes, invoked via some wrapper, but we can still issue commands via stdin.

    Fix a problem with v4 ars import
    
    The ars_rd_curve function decrements npts and has a for loop that
    continues as long as npts is positive.  When this type is size_t
    (converted in 0caf2092a24dd) npts overflows and wipes out.  Instead
    of size_t, use the signed ssize_t version so it can go negative.

    Update log with commits since 2020-09-14
    
    This is too aggressive in that it's probably going to incorporate many
    commits from earlier patch releases that were cherrypicked, but Git's
    approach to storing history makes it very difficult to identify the set
    of commits uniquely present in this release but not patch releases.  So,
    at least this time, we generate an aggressive ChangeLog.

    Fixed Archer's resetting of perspective angle to 0
    
    Looks like commit af045f79 did end up addressing a problem in Archer -
    if you brought up the Preferences dialog, went to the display tab, and
    adjusted the perspective angle, once off of zero (orthogonal view) you
    wouldn't have previously been able to restore it to that value.

    Remove nburst rewrite of burst code
    
    Burst is now deprecated - there's not much point in trying to maintain a
    proposed modernized replacement for the old code, since no further work
    is forthcoming.  Note remove in NEWS, since nburst was mentioned in
    7.32.0.

    extern arary declarations shouldn't typically specify size.
    
    it masks any inconsistency between definition and declaration, akin to a size cast, resulting in runtime badness.  if size is needed, general trick is to define size where the array is defined (as a separate symbol, bleh), and provide a declaration in the public header as well.

    gracefully handle bogus arcs instead of potentially introducing a dramatic behavior change.
    
    it was proceeding before, which means potentially failing an entire extrude that was working.  here the intent seems to be an arc that degraded to a circle (which should be fine) or an arc with numerics that got wonky due to precision.  instead we clamp and proceed as we would have before but without bad math.

    this function doesn't need/use dbip other than keying on it to know if we have a flipped v4.  reduce to just where the dbip_version is used.

    questioning this change as it seems to expose the API design to an implementation detail unneccesarily, making it more complicated to use the API in the process.  asking apps to track their argv0 for sake of crash reporting is not an intended or desirable design, and it doesn't scale well.

    note the mged features removed, sans editorialization.
    
    these should not have been removed on a patch release, given the nature and extent of changes, and the simple reason that doing so violated CHANGES (no notice given, removal incomplete, no alternatives for some)

    screengrab/overlay framebuffer options documented in 7.32.0
    
    Chris ran these down - the upshot of the changes was to add the options
    to screengrab and overlay, rather than adding new commands or removing
    existing commands.  screengrab and overlay man pages document the new
    options.  Still need to consider how to approach fb2pix et. al. at some
    point, but not currently a priority.

    emacs key bindings in shell context have nothing to do with emacs...
    
    need to discuss impact/alternatives.  running btclsh in emacs isn't a
    substitute for the key bindings as they have nothing to do with each
    other... that's kind of like saying we're removing blender mouse
    bindings because we found a way to run mged commands in blender.
    non sequitur.
    
    emacs key bindings are merely the canonical name for default bindings
    provided by essentially all shell environments (including sh, bash,
    zsh, etc) where, for example, ctrl-a/ctrl-e goes to beginning/end of
    line.  to remove them means removing btclsh and bwish CLI navigation
    without substution or benefit to users.  it degrades and devalues them
    arguably to irrelevance.

    Replace wdb_close altogether with db_close
    
    With the new setup, the meat of wdb_close is now just db_close.  Leaving
    a wdb_close in, but replace all current uses in the code with the direct
    db_close call.  Clarifies intent and simplifies.
    
    Looking at 7.32.6 uses of wdb_close, I think I've got all the spurious
    calls introduced during the wdb rework removed - we only want the close
    operation when we're intending to close the dbip itself.

    wdb_close needs to db_close for wdb_fopen
    
    The wdb_fopen and wdb_fopen_v functions do an all-up db_create, which
    means conceptually they are managing the dbip themselves and need
    wdb_close to also take down the dbip.  We don't want that when we're
    doing db_open based dbip work, so we let wdb_close know via a flag that
    it is responsible for doing db_close when the wdb API is assuming
    ownership of the dbip.
    
    Josh noticed this manifesting when a .g created with a GED keep command
    produced a .g file that couldn't be moved until MGED was closed (which
    released the file.)

    Actually, if we're going to do full open/close operations for intermediate steps, the temp file won't work for garbage_collect.

    Make a stab at enabling the librt datum unit test
    
    Originally this test was disabled, because the bu_temp_file trick it
    uses didn't work reliably cross platform - in some cases fclose on the
    FILE pointer immediately deletes the temp file, with no opportunity for
    the program to re-open it with a db_open.  So instead, we provide a db
    initialization routine that accepts the FILE pointer and does all
    necessary work without ever closing it.  Works on Ubuntu Linux, but
    needs cross platform testing.
    
    If this ends up working well, there are more places in the code where we
    should be using it - really, any time we need to create a temporary .g
    file.  The garbage_collect command is one obvious possibility, but there
    are very likely others...

    Add -N option for specifying overlay view obj name
    
    This is redundant right now with the second argv option to overlay, but
    it is setting the stage for the deprecation of that argv behavior in
    order to allow overlay to accept multiple plot files as inputs.  -N
    allows the original behavior to be achieved by supporting custom view
    object naming, once the current behavior is removed.

    Update man pages for brep command/subcommands
    
    The 7.32.6 release does have the current form of the BRep commands (the
    work to reorganize them is considerably older), but it looks like the
    man pages weren't adjusted or clarified much when that work was done.
    In part that was due to most of brep being a very low level command, not
    used much in day-to-day workflows. However, there are a few items like
    flip and valid that are of more frequent use to modelers, and when we do
    need things like plotting we really need them...  Go ahead and do some
    cleanup on the documentation.

    Comment out stub for brep weld subcommand
    
    This is still a feature we want - it is intended to help in cases where
    we end up with conversions that have individual surfaces which are
    physically located in space in such a way that they together define a
    closed volume, but lack the topological connections that constitute a
    proper BRep definition.  However, it's implementation is somewhat
    non-trivial and it's probably going to end up unimplemented until we hit
    a problem that requires it.

    possible solution to tcl IO 'puts' error
    
    It looks like the error was being caused by threads lingering after
    Tcl_UnregisterChannel incorrectly signaling the new write threads from
    Tcl_MakeFileChannel. Calling puts with an empty string immediately after
    unregistering/making a new channel for stdout and stderr appears to sync
    the cleanup and ensures puts is available for the current session.

    Set better management of rt_wdb I/O stream types
    
    MGED is opening two wdb streams on a single dbip - one inmem, and one
    disk (via libged).  In principle this isn't forbidden by the APIs, but
    it causes a practical difficulty in that db_i stores only one dbi_wdbp
    pointer.  If code expects its assigned wdbp to be present in
    dbip->dbi_wdbp and someone else assigns a new wdbp with a different type
    in a function call somewhere, Bad (and rather odd) things tend to
    happen.  libwdb I/O routines will start working differently than the
    caller expected them to, for no apparent reason.
    
    Upon examination, the dbi_wdbp pointer is really supposed to be regarded
    as private, and the main thing it controls is how read/write operations
    access data. (Separate experimentation in a branch proved that
    essentially all the other contents of rt_wdb can be successfully moved
    either down to db_i or up to libged/libtclcad/etc. - the type is the key
    to libwdb's behavioral changes.)  To handle the MGED scenario of
    multiple different simultaneous wdb stream types, we alter the logic to
    have db_open and db_close set up the four potentially needed stream
    types once, and manage them separately using different private pointers
    (this whole "private db_instance vars" setup needs to be moved to a
    hidden implementation struct, but that's for later...)
    
    This approach results in wdb_dbopen becoming a pass-through returning
    one of the four db_instance managed streams, which at first glance looks
    like it might be removing a potential ability of client codes to create
    and manage their own rt_wdb structures.   However, the need to keep the
    dbip and dbi_wdbp pointers in sync meant that was never a realistic
    possibility.  MGED's wdb_obj.c code referencing the rtg_headwdb global
    stores rt_wdb pointers in a list, but as near as I can tell this logic
    will always result in new rt_wdb pointers associated with new db_open
    calls, rather than expecting a new rt_wdb to reference the same dbip.
    
    The new approach also has the advantage of making each use of the wdbp
    clear as far as intent - rather than hoping dbi_wdbp is holding the
    right stream type for the job, the library or app requests exactly what
    it needs explicitly and locally.  wdb_close is currently a no-op -
    db_close will do the cleanup - but it is added in most cases anyway to
    express the intent of treating the wdb stream interface as a local
    phenomena rather than setting up global, db_i wide state.
    
    A consequence of this refactor was to expose a variety of direct uses of
    the "private" dbi_wdbp pointer, which are now replaced with calls to
    wdb_dbopen.  The next step is to look at libged's ged_wdbp - using this
    approach, it should be possible to dispense with it entirely in favor of
    dbip + wdb_dbopen.
    
    I note in passing that at the moment rt_wdb is being used to track
    counting and prefixing strings - as near as I can tell this logic is
    used only in libged commands, not in librt or libwdb.  We should
    consider whether those variables would make more sense living in libged
    as well.  Tolerance and resource variables, on the other hand, almost
    certainly belong with the dbip itself - in particular, moving resource
    from rt_wdb to db_instance will almost certainly be a major step towards
    removal of rt_uniresource as a global, and thanks to the rt_wdb struct
    holding a dbip pointer may even be minimally impacting.  (None of those
    changes are in this commit, however.)

    First cut at a libged garbage_collect cmd
    
    Since we need to look at the garbage_collect command anyway, go ahead
    and recast it as a libged command so it will be more widely available.
    Give the opportunity for mishap with this command it needs another set
    of eyes, and probably warrants some test cases as well so we can check
    it across all platforms more easily.  Approach taken is to do a low
    level transcription of the bu_external data, without unpacking further.

    use vectors in lieu of sets to retain object ordering
    
    std::sets order insertions, which results in objects being alphabatized after
    conversions. Continue to use sets to retain uniqueness but write the
    combs using a vector to preserve order.
    note that this will show some names being added/deleted when running a
    gdiff of the set implementation vs the vector implementation. This is
    due to the lookup ordering and renaming within the 'polish_output'
    section. When orphaned objects part of nested layers are encountered in this function it will
    rename according to the database ordering - since we have now changed the
    order additions/deletions are reported although all geometry is
    accounted for.

    Remove HIDDEN define in favor of plain 'static'
    
    In my experience the extra layer of the HIDDEN definition isn't
    particularly useful - if we're going to be static, we don't want to also
    have to worry about name conflicts if a build setting changes, and if
    the "don't inline" case is still useful it appears to come up very
    rarely.  Motivation for doing this now is that it looks like OpenMesh
    also has a HIDDEN definition that collides with ours...  There are
    probably other ways to handle that, but might as well use it as a prod
    to do the HIDDEN -> static scrub.

    disable regress-asc and regress-weight temporarily.
    
    this is the least invasive, least disruptive way to temporarily disable the regression failures that are being actively worked on and debugged.  it leaves the test binaries themselves in tact so debugging can continue.  getting time to finish testing and fixing the regression proper has been taking a while admist repeat ongoing interruptions.  getting the tests back online will help to ensure additional issues aren't introduced and CI can be useful again.
    
    intent remains to re-enable with prejudice as soon as possible as the regression failures are still release blockers.

    Set PERMISSIONS on file(COPY) to match CMake
    
    This use of the PERMISSIONS options has a downside - it sets ALL the
    file permissions, without preserving any of the pre-existing flags.
    It's resulting in executables not being runnable when they go through
    this logic path.  Work around it by trying to set all the flags to match
    what we would get out of default CMake file creation.
    
    This is an unfortunate limitation of file(COPY), and is further
    compounded by what as far as I can tell is an inability in CMake to read
    the existing permissions off the file portably. Thus we can't even read
    the permissions from the file to make an attempt to craft a permissions
    preserving copy command manually.  The only other option I know of would
    be to make a CMake function wrapper around execing the various platform
    specific commands to do this, and if this works I'd prefer to avoid
    having to create and manage that solution...

    rename rt/nmg.h to rt/nmg_conv.h
    
    this requires adapting headers in other places, but avoids situations where there seemed to be problems finding the right nmg.h header.  renaming to nmg_conv.h identified a handful of places where headers were not being included correctly and made two duplicate structs obvious (removed hitmiss and another).

    fix longstanding permissions denied errors building on windows.
    
    tcl's build on windows installs the msg files read-only, which causes problems during repeat compile+clean+compile or reconfigure cycles.  particularly with the default cmake ninja build in msvc2019, the errors are incessantly reported and can't be cleared.  here we ensure owner can read/write the files, which makes rebuilding happier.

    Back in 2014, I tried to switch away from throwing exceptions.  I'm thinking now that was a mistake - I believe I mis-interpreted a crash as a failure to handle an exception, and so concluded erroneously that the exception mechanism wasn't the way to go.  Try to restore the code to its state prior to making the 'use pointer' changes.

    Count our recursion depth and bail if too deep
    
    This is cheap, but other roads to avoiding crashing via robustness
    improvements are looking to be a lot of work, so let's see if this can
    keep us running in the meantime...  throw an exception if we recurse too
    deeply calling edge events.  We don't get a mesh if this happens, but
    hopefully we also don't crash.  Need to test with the non-scrubbed logic
    and real geometry, but does avoid wiping out with one of the scrubbed
    test cases.

    Remove unused files
    
    As far as I can tell, these files aren't used.  Remove them in
    preparation for trying to merge in upstream changes.
    
    Looking at netpbm's recent versions, we may have a problem...  We
    removed nstring from netpbm some years back due to license issues.  In
    the most recent version, it is still using a GPL license, and is
    definitely used in a number of places.  Not immediately clear how
    difficult it's going to be to identify and merge in upstream changes
    while keeping nstring out of the mix...

    Make a stab at incorporating a fix for Mac builds
    
    It looks as if there's an issue with the CMake code for PNG with modern
    XCode:
    https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/pull/1946
    https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/pull/403
    
    This commit makes a stab at adapting the version from
    https://github.com/libpng/libpng/pull/2
    
    onto our (somewhat simplified) png build.
    
    It looks as if libpng doesn't currently have much in the way of an
    active upstream (no new releases in a number of years), so will need to
    keep an eye out to see what the eventual solution is.

    Adjust how scene obj settings are propagated
    
    When selecting an LoD mesh, the highlighting wasn't getting propagated
    down to the view specific objects.  By default, we don't want the
    non-LoD settings to be independent on these objects, so adjust the scene
    object to optionally allow specifying a pointer to another object's
    settings to allow for simple sharing.
    
    We also need to let the drawing routines know to rebuild their dlists if
    the settings change (since normally they're rebuilt only when the data
    needs to adjust to something like a new LoD view.)  Add a bu_obj_stale
    function to handle the bookkeeping.

    Checkpoint test of a different selection approach
    
    Experimenting with a large comb tree suggests that Qt's QTreeView
    scrolling performance drops off when a large number of rows are
    selected.  See if we can use the mechanism we already have in place for
    highlighting drawing to do our own "selection" which doesn't use the Qt
    mechanism.  Preliminary testing suggests this will be more performant,
    so stashing the current state.

    Disable first object only select for rect - doesn't really make much sense.  If we eventually add a mode where we shoot a grid of rays within the rect, as opposed to just a bbox selection, it might make more sense, but right now the results will be fairly unintuitive.  This is mainly useful when you want to select a whole lot of objects simultaneously.

    Whee.  selectionChanged is connected to ged_deselect, and was getting triggered even when we were in the middle of a sync.  This was mutating the selection set while in the process of trying to sync the tree to reflect the current selection set.  Hilarity ensued.  Once it was clear what was happing, fix is simple - check for the sync flag before proceeding with the deselect logic.

    gcc thinks it sees a path through the logic where we can end up decrementing name to before cmdname buffer.  if true, that means we'd be writing nul a byte out of range.  this change adds the buffer len and keeps track where we're at.

    When we have GED syncing in the mix, we need to deselect (and remove from the GED set) top level paths (if any are selected) before trying to remove lower level paths.  If we go the other way, the remove of a lower level path with a higher level one active will activate all the other children of the lower level path ('preserving' the activity of the higher level path), which is not the behavior we want here

    Hmm. Qt6 is getting a mouseMoveEvent in the GL widget, even if the left mouse button isn't pressed.  This seems reasonable enough, but it's not how Qt5 behaved, therefore the enabled view manipulation mode always runs in Qt6, even if the left mouse button isn't pressed.  Correct this by adding a check to make sure we have a button press before proceeding.

    and provide an automatic workaround.  nobody should rely on this workaround, and it's not portable (assumes x86_64).  a better test would be to run the /lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 dynamic linker and see if it still exhibits the capture behavior, or to specify LD_PRELOAD as environment on the tools that must run during compilation.

    Use the selection model to restrict selections
    
    For .g tree widget purposes, we don't want to simultaneously have
    selected a child and a parent along the same tree path - conceptually,
    it is difficult to know what that implies for operations like editing
    and drawing (if tire.r and rim.c are both selected, do we only want
    tire.r?  Or only tire.r/rim.c? - in that case, if tire.r is selected,
    rim.c should be cleared.  Conversely, if tire.r/rim.c is selected, the
    parent tire.r selection is cleared so we can focus on rim.c)
    
    However, we DO allow multiple selections so long as each selection is on
    its own independent db_fullpath in the tree - one selection per path.
    So while a parent comb may have multiple children selected
    simultaneously, if the parent comb is selected all of the child
    selections are cleared, since the parent comb is in all of those paths.
    
    We still need to get this syncing with the GED sets, but that will
    require a slight modification to what we prototyped earlier for those
    sets.  We don't want to automatically collapse the selected paths to
    their most compact form - if we have a comb instance T/C with children
    1, 2 and 3 and we select T/C/1 T/C/2 and T/C/3, the implication is we
    want to edit those three instance matrices rather than the T/C instance
    matrix.  However, since the 1,2,3 selections would constitute a full
    selection of all of C's children, the collapse operation in GED would
    shrink the path to T/C.

    Move the highlighting functions to selection model
    
    Not trying to improve the integration or enable any new features at this
    point - this is just an incremental relocation of the logic while trying
    to keep things functional.  Next cleanup step will be to eliminate the
    proxy model completely.

    Demonstrate color/font adjustment in item drawing
    
    Embedding a checkbox is looking like it will be more trouble than it's
    worth.  Instead, look at adjusting the text color/style to reflect
    drawing status.  This way, we can (in principle) use the text for scene
    visibility indications and background colors for selection status.

    Checkpoint experiment with checkbox drawing
    
    Since we want to use the highlighting colors to indicate selection
    states, probably want to see if we can use checkboxes to indicate
    whether items are drawn or not.
    
    This is probably going to be tricky - we use a custom painter to get
    full control of the item drawing, so if we want the mouse click on
    top of the widget to set the check box and not toggle the selection
    state, there'll probably be some gnarly event handling to do...

    Start setting up for a custom QItemSelectionModel
    
    Trying to work with GED selection sets and the tree view, I'm thinking
    more and more that the original intent of the QgSelectionProxyModel
    would be better served by the item selection model.  I'm having
    difficulty trying to sync the selections with GED, which suggests I'm
    trying to do so at the wrong point in the Qt logic flows.
    
    As a preliminary stage, move everything not directly related to the tree
    view item highlighting down to QgModel (this doesn't involve any
    knowledge of tree view types in QgModel, so we're good there.)  The next
    stages will be more involved, since we'll need to change a fair bit of
    qged logic to remove the proxy model in favor of QgModel.  The state
    management for the edit modes vs. view modes highlighting will also have
    to be significantly reworked to function in its new location.  Expect
    some disruptions as this proceeds.
    
    End state goal is to have the tree view mode highlighting accurately
    reflect the GED selected paths state arrived at by set additions and
    removals (and ultimately update the displayed Qt tree selections in
    response to the GED select command on the command line, although that'll
    be another level of challenge.)  Once all that is in sync, we can return
    to the primitive editing question, since we'll have proper selection
    sets on which to operate.  For single selections this was never a
    challenge, but it is eminently plausible that users will want to select
    and (say) move multiple instances of multiple combs simultaneously, and
    we don't want our infrastructure to come up short due to design
    defects...

    Get GED default selection set updating in response to QGED tree selections, but that immediately exposes a problem with multiple selections - the highlighting will need to be 'smart' with respect to what's actually active in a .g tree (for example, if we deselect all children, the parent shouldn't remain selected.)

    change cpuset_t vs cpu_set_t declaration.
    
    switch the assumption from checking the cpu_set_t type being in sched.h to simply whether we have either sched.h or sys/cpuset.h headers.  one or the other must exist in order to do pthread affinity, so we'll assume cpuset_t is in sys/cpuset.h on bsd (note the bsd v linux comments were reversed/wrong) and otherwise we have cpu_set_t.

    Improve code quality.
    
    typedef structs for readability. Give structs cpp style constructor and destructor where appropriate to handle null initialization, and better manage memory and its cleanup.
    correct a handful of memory leaks.
    improved shader preservation and generation.
    replaced bu_exit where possible with cascade returns as it interrupts gcv completion and cleanup.

    compiler noticed when setmode() wasn't used and issued warnings, so make sure to use it.
    
    worked on linux, but this approach still may be problematic on other compilers.  if it is, there are still other things we can do that are more of a burden, so trying this first.

    define an empty setmode() stub.
    
    quelling a windows warning exposed a limitation of #defining setmode() away.  it resulted in a stray (void) cast syntax error, so we instead provide a no-op function instead.  may need another approach if this isn't robust as system setmode() is being masked and we're relying on the compiler to resolve this properly as a static.

    in order to maintain the higher precision, the data containers need to also be upgraded.  mac and linux were failing rightly so on the implicit down-conversion.  of course, if we bump the parser, we have to also bump the plugin.

Date:   Sun Jul 10 12:50:02 2022 -0400

    Introduce NORETURN as a new function annotation.
    
    Similar to DEPRECATED, this utilizes config testing, but does not require it as the fallback condition is a no-op.  This label marks a function that nominally doesn't return under normal behavior (e.g., exceptions, jumps, and such notwithstanding).  This helps with warnings generated by compilers and code anlaysis by static analyzers.

    visual studio requires __declspec and other annotations precede the function to be valid syntax, so move most tests to the beginning.
    
    also add new tests for deprecated, which was being assumed.   this consequently also fixes __forceinline too.  moving compiler attributes to the front not only makes the tests pass where available better but sets the stage for making all the annotations become common features that can be used anywhere.

    Add noreturn annotations for msvc.
    
    Annoyingly, this requires moving the attribute to the front of declarations because __declspec(noreturn) is only syntactically valid at the front.  Does address about 100+ warnings, though.  Also fixed naming inconsistency with ANALYZER vs ANALYZE in clang's no-return attribute.

    Add path detection based on libbu location
    
    Up until now we've been using the executable runtime path to deduce the
    BRL-CAD root path, but that only works for our own executables.  If an
    external program in a different location needs this location, its
    executable path will be incorrect.
    
    When the whereami code supports it, prefer constructing the root path
    based on libbu's location.  We'll still fall back on trying the
    executable if that should fail, but when using libbu's location works it
    will be viable even for non-BRL-CAD programs.

    remove GED_ prefix on command-specific symbols.
    
    GED_ prefix is reserved for public symbols for readability.  It makes it much easier to know at a glance which symbols are API and which are implementation detail.  Convention for internal symbols and implemetation detail is to prefix using command name, here FACETIZE_ as prefix instead.

    drop the _bu_ prefix.
    
    _bu_prefix is intended only for internal implemetation functions that must be exported for some reason.  design pattern convention is to use a prefix that matches the API grouping (here 'mem' group) while keeping them static implementation detail.

    address some bu_mem() design issues
    
    very little (if any) other libbu api has return codes passed as
    parameters.  instead design the api to both returning an error code
    and/or the requested size type as is done with read()/write().
    currently also retains passing a parameter to be set, but might make
    sense to drop it.
    
    also notably using size_t and ssize_t since those types make more
    sense designwise as well.  they're defined as types capable of
    representing memory sizes, so they're rather appropriate for a
    function that obtains memory sizes.

    This reverts commit 6eb58567c0e61dea5ee2fb0ec54485d423057ea2.
    
    This was no bueno as CPP_STR stringifies BU_DIR_SEPARATOR.  It needed
    to be CPP_XSTR() but then still ends up as "'\'" which isn't helpful.
    Will instead deal with the potential overflow a different way.

    implement support for negative CPU counts.
    
    that allows users to specify all but a certain number of CPUs (e.g., -1 == all cores except 1 core).  -P0 means all available, i.e., the default.  also fixed the Planning processor(s) plural.

    option handler shouldn't be printing to anything.
    
    doing so assumes calling app can even display to std out/err or wants to have that happen.  instead, pull that validation, remapping, and printing logic back into app front-end where it's entirely appropriate to output as it establishes the output context.
    
    logic was changed so that enabling any debug (bu's, librt's or liboptiocal's) will let the app utilize a #cpu specification greater than what would otherwise be allowed.

    always call MPI_Finalize on exit.
    
    instead of manually calling MPI_Finalize() at every possible exit site (and still missing some bu_bomb/bu_exit sites), register an atexit handler to ensure it's called.  greatly simplifies the code eliminating the nasty spattering of ifdef turds.

    remove the USE_FORKED_THREADS hack.
    
    it was implemented in support of the 2001 linux kernel (2.4) which had a bug affecting thread accounting.  this workaround spawned all threads in a subprocess, whose accounting did not have the bug so rt statistics could be calculated accurately.  support for the 2.4 kernel ended in 2011, so plenty of time to let the hack go.  if it's still needed, it may make more sense to have libbu simply do its own time accounting.

    eliminate the compile-time variance and restore MPI.
    
    Introducing RT_TXT_OUTPUT consequently commented out important MPI calls and introduced code and build complexity in order to avoid libdm linkage.  restoring to keep it simpler.  It also created secondary runtime behavior that we don't test (hence MPI), but really for simplicity, easier understanding.
    
    Revert "Add backend dependencies for rt targets, but in the process limit the libdm linkage to those commands that might display graphically."
    
    This reverts commit 0c61982e31da09a9a46d381e768d4007d9eb6967.

    looks like starseeker probably fixed rtweight infinite loop.
    
    rtweight was changed over to libanalyze for .density file parsing back in 2019, so attributing the change to a prior release.  also looks like it no longer reports infinite volumes also when file is empty, but does report nan centroids if density is 0.

    instead, now only reports air exposed at the beginning or end of shotlines.  this undoes the change introduced in 00e3074fa8fcc8142a4849001dd2486a3721c2fe which included gapped air reporting but considering it minimally impacting due to the fact that gapped air is still reported via -Ag as a workaround (note -Ag reports all geometry gaps) until we figure out with users if there needs to be a separate Analysis mode specifically for gapped air.

    The previous commit is not going to work. Object full paths need to be preserved when checking to ensure hierarcial information is maintainted.
    
    Major change to find_cmd_line_obj so that now the full path is compared by split along slashes instead of only checking the parent. Also changed the return type to be the object pointer instead of an int for the index for a more intuitive return.
    Added error checking and a log cap to make the issue apparent but reduce memory use and unnecessary blather.

    Merge pull request #47 from f4alt/nirt
    
    Nirt options cleanup when run within mged.  This makes it so -h -L and -f all work on nirt when run from within mged.  Plot wireframe behavior wasn't tested.  Mged prints in triplicate, but appears to be a side effect of echoing stdout and returning it as a result string (should maybe return empty) and echoing the result string.

    register is a no-go for c++.
    
    there's a chance this one affects ray tracing, but quick look indicates impact is hopefully limited to prep, tree walking, and bot pieces.

    converting to c++ means register warnings, quelled.
    
    fortunately, all these instances appear to be in prep and not the raytrace loop where register still appears to make a significant performance difference (10% iirc) after optimized compilation during ray tracing.

    this file was clearly auto-generated at some point in time and it got a lot of things wrong, and has been edited incorrectly several times since as well.  this update corrects hundreds of style errors, ensures all commands are bolded, all commands at least beginning at the proper indent scope, and gets rid of unhelpful and inconsistent scaling.  did not attempt to correct ALL the errors as there are too many and this file should become autogenerated.  did add a new menu that auto-adapts commands into columns and improves the overall presentation.

    For menu action on tree items, we want the new comb instance aware fullpath strings.  Proof out a way to get them from the QgItem data

commit 7d396a185d9dc8111229e132893c68469d774a92
Merge: e3a372ca6b 67cb429f0f

    Merge branch 'instance_spec' into main
    
    This logic implements a way to specify specific comb instances to
    command line commands.  For example, the tree:
    
    comb
      u [M1] obj
      u [M2] obj
      u [M3] obj
    
    traditionally has been difficult for commands to deal with - if the user
    wishes to (say) draw or erase only the comb/[M2]obj instance from a
    scene, there hasn't been a good way to do it.
    
    These changes add support for a "@#" syntax to reference individual
    instances.  In the above example, the particular instances of obj would
    be addressed as follows:
    
    comb/[M1]obj -> comb/obj or comb/obj@0
    comb/[M2]obj -> comb/obj@1
    comb/[M3]obj -> comb/obj@2
    
    For the time being, this feature is off by default - this syntax means
    that full path -> string translations will no longer result in path
    strings whose sub-strings consist solely of valid object names, and
    logic that expects this (i.e is not aware of the @# suffixes and how to
    deal with them) will break.  It is being integrated in disabled form to
    avoid getting out of sync with the main tree - the changes are somewhat
    complex in the code, and would make for a difficult merge if main
    underwent any significant alterations.
    
    For applications to enable the behavior, they can set the
    LIBRT_USE_COMB_INSTANCE_SPECIFIERS environment variable:
    
    bu_setenv("LIBRT_USE_COMB_INSTANCE_SPECIFIERS", "1", 1);
    
    Right now, only the experimental qged interface exposes this behavior.
    It has been tested with the new draw and erase implementations, and rt
    is able to raytrace scene descriptions passed by ert that are generated
    by erasing instances from the scene.  This feature will be needed when
    we enable draw and erase menu items for the tree widget, whose entries
    represent individual unique instances.  There are also implications for
    the GED edit command that haven't been explored yet - they will be
    considered when we look at the edit command and its integration with
    qged.

    Test adding a behavior flag to the db_i struct
    
    Since the comb instance path support is disruptive, we need a way to
    enable/disable it (at least in the early stages) so we don't break
    existing logic.  dbip is present when we are setting up db_full_path
    structures, so that is where we need to add a setting if we aren't going
    to otherwise change the API.  As long as the fp_cinst array is zero
    (i.e. its default) the strings generated for full paths will be the
    standard strings of current behavior, and if we can key the setting of
    fp_cinst based on this value being 1, we should be able to allow qged to
    enable this behavior while leaving it off for everyone else by default.

    If subtraction paths get specified, we don't want them showing up in the image - e.g. "./bin/rt matrix_tests.g sphs/comb_sph1 /sphs/comb_sph1@2" - comb_sph1@2 is subtracted from sphs and so shouldn't make a positive contributeion to the image.  Not entirely sure if this is the correct place to do this check - feels like we should be catching it earlier - but checkpoint it since it seems to work.  Note that this probably isn't what we want for pick mode, so probably needs more thought.

    Checkpoint work on hierarchy instance specification
    
    Got as far as draw and erase in qged being able to draw and erase
    specific comb instances using the "@#" notation for paths.
    
    However, ert (embedded raytracing) does not work, because the raytracing
    layer doesn't correctly process the new path syntax.  libged can pass
    the paths to rt, but rt won't know what to do with them.  Adding support
    for the new syntax will involve some scary changes to the core of the
    librt tree walking layers, so it's time for a branch.
    
    This is painful, but appears to be necessary for proper support of a
    number of graphical interface features.  It first came up when using the
    erase mouse tool to clear objects out of a scene - reported paths in
    "who" weren't unique after such erasures, highlighting the lack of a way
    to address specific instances on the command line.  Such interaction
    modes make it more likely we'll need to raytrace otherwise atypical
    lists of instances, which will eventually result in an incorrect visual
    as the user erases one instance and rt interprets the specifier as a
    different instance.  Another, more readily observable problem is what
    happens if we want to add support to the tree widget for selecting and
    drawing specific instances in the tree - the tree exposes all instances,
    but to visualize them we need to pass a unique string specifier to the
    draw command, and we don't (or didn't, at any rate) have a way to do so.
    And even if we were to add some convoluted hack specific to the tree to
    try and work around this, we'd still have the ert problem.
    
    Once it is clear what logic changes are needed for this to work
    correctly, we can decide how to introduce it back into main.  There's a
    decent chance we can't use the environment variable guards used for the
    GED commands for speed reasons, so we may have to introduce a new
    function stack with the intent of it eventually replacing the current
    logic once it proves out.  For testing purposes in the branch we'll make
    the changes in-situ to avoid unnecessary complications, but it would
    almost certainly be too risky to merge the changes in that form.

    Added support for nirt text output options (namely 'help' and 'list output formats') when running within mged.
    
    This is primarily done by loading the nirt_debug flag '-X' with 'ged' before sending the command directly to nirt so we output the correct usage within mged context without duplicating commands.
    
    Began support for -f fmt within mged
    Option is now recognized and printed to user, however line duplication and formatting needs to be resolved.
    
    Corrected an off by one error which gave a bad return code when help was requested in src/nirt

    Adjust hash calculation to produce an op/mat agnostic icnt value

Date:   Wed Jun 1 16:44:02 2022 -0400

    Not using hash mode - remove.
    
    Coming up against a long standing problem - commands like draw and erase
    don't have a good way to specify specific instances of comb trees.  For
    example, if we have:
    
    a
      u [M1] b
      u [M2] b
      - [M3] b
    
    and we want to draw or erase just the M2 instance of a/b, we don't have
    a way to specify it.  This is a problem when operating the graphical
    erase plugin on scene object paths, since the scene objects correspond
    to specific a/b style instances but we don't have any way to translate
    those concepts into individual GED command manipulations.  (Nor is the
    problem unique to that case - it is just the most current example.)  The
    bookkeeping needed for drawing contraindicates trying to evolve some
    sort of special case manipulation for this particular situation - we
    need a way for GED commands (and librt prep, for that matter) to
    individually specify specific comb tree instances.  The same problem
    arises when we think about defining custom sets of instances based on
    selections from the scene.

    Start thinking about object set selection.
    
    For editing, view drawing object changes with graphical selection, etc.
    we want to hone in on the concept of "working sets" of objects.  We
    don't have sed/oed, but we do have to have some sense of which object or
    objects in the who set we intend to apply edit operations to.  We also
    want Archer's ability to graphically identify objects to erase from the
    current drawn set, and probably other abilities as well.

    Reconnect the fb_mode toggle
    
    This button exposes a weakness in the current signal/slot design for
    view management - the button will toggle the view, but does not update
    the view settings plugin.  This is a side effect of needing to avoid
    triggering an event which will force GUI updates if the gui is itself
    the origin of the action to initiate change, which has potential for
    infinite looping, but in this case also results in one GUI element not
    correctly reflecting a view state change as a consequence of action by
    another GUI widget.  We also must bear in mind that both elements may
    need updating as a consequence of view state changes driven by a command
    line command.
    
    Need to take a step back and consider what changes are needed.

    deviated from expected behavior, so change function name to bu_whence()
    
    avoids any misunderstanding about which paths are being searched, with the intent being that it's a function that tells us where a given executable item is located with priority given to the user PATH.  might make sense to realpath relative paths being returned, but keeping which's unadulterated behavior for now.

    merge system path searching from bu_whereis into bu_which
    
    while they are different with bu_whereis specifically searching system paths and bu_which only looking in the user's PATH, that's not a helpful distinction when we're looking for programs.  moreover, our whereis behavior wasn't strictly conforming as system whereis also reports back all matching results and we only returned the first.  so this change has it look in both user and system locations until it finds the command in question.  probably should rename as behavior is no longer posix-striving.

    avoid unhelpful blather.
    
    if bu_dir fails, itk_redefines.tcl can't be found.  bu_dir needs to always work or we need separate logic for build-dir searching in apps like archer.  regardless, message is issued during pkgIndexing, which is not relevant then anyways.

    consistent grid spacing
    
    - always use gridSpacing as grid spacing value
    - shifted the grid a bit more to the middle by starting the first ray at
    "min + gridSpacing / 2" instead of "min + gridSpacing"
    - the rays are generated from 1 to state.steps - 1, i.e. the number of
    steps is in fact state.steps - 1, which should be state.span /
    gridSpacing, on the other hand

    add geometry visibility script!
    
    This script calculates visibility for specified eye points at given base object(s) with optional occluder(s).  It autogenerates a stack of images, labels, and more into an annotated top-down and perspective view rendering for those eye points with exceptional analytic effect.  this script really could be turned into a full-fledged generally-useful application, but was rapidly prototyped for a real use case.  it's included here in a raw state to preserve it.

    As with transparency, make the internal lighting value the only/canonical value so we don't have to be concerned about syncing issues.

Date:   Mon May 9 17:48:05 2022 -0400

    Consolidate the transparency variables
    
    Rather confusingly, the opengl display managers (the only ones that
    currently support transparency) use both an internal variable and an
    entry in the dm calltable to track and report transparency.
    
    This change consolidates to use the internal variable, with a
    getTransparency function replacing the dm_transparency variable.  Any
    backend that implements a transparency setting can define it the same way
    the OpenGL backends define their mvars settings.
    
    Longer term we may also want to replace all the variable specific
    function pointers with some variation on _dm_cmd_get so we don't
    have to keep changing the calltable every time a backend wants to expose
    a new setting...
