    Add previous facetize logic back in as facetize_old
    
    Because the new facetize system is such a radical departure from older
    codes, add the 7.38.2 facetize logic to have as a backup under the
    command name facetize_old.  This can go away as we get more confidence
    in the new setup, so it's not being announced as a command per-say, but
    it will be available to try if the new logic isn't working for some
    reason.

    Remove nmg.h include from rt/geom.h
    
    knot_vector is defined in nmg.h, but its use in rtgeom isn't related to NMG.
    It's simple, so just define it directly for the seg purpose it is used for
    here and avoid the unnecessary nmg coupling.

    Optimize how we process per-region facetizations
    
    We were treating each region like a complete conversion, but we don't
    want to do that - it's inefficient and launches too many subprocesses.
    Instead, handle all the solids up front and then handle just the boolean
    evaluations individually.

    In situations where the LIEF rpath management isn't working, the
    BRLCAD_DISABLE_RELOCATION variable can be enabled to disable the bext

    set all necessary variables on the configure line so BRL-CAD can find
    the necessary components for building.

    Update stl-g object naming
    
    Use some of the VLS simplification and cleanup routines we've developed over
    the years to improve stl-g object naming.  Also, per user request, skipping
    text inside < > bracketing when making object names.
    
    Switching solid and region names from using prefix (s. and r.) to suffix (.s
    and .r) naming conventions.  These extensions are often viewed similarly to
    filename extensions (and using suffixes has the advantage of allowing
    bu_path_component to break down the names as well.)

    Fix filter return settings for search -or case
    
    Chris noticed a problem with the db_search return value when using the
    -or filter - numerical return values were order dependent.  Bookkeeping
    of the return values in the f_or loop processing was incorrect - we were
    zeroing out if the last filter didn't match, when what we need to do is
    track if any of the filters was successful and report accordingly.

    GetUserNameEx is not part of standard Windows API
    
    Ex is only part of the Windows security API which is not linked with
    WinBase. Including it would only gain slightly improved username
    formatting - which we're not utilizing anyhow. Instead, let's only use
    the base supplied GetUserName function.

    Validate the repair results, only use clean output
    
    The bot repair routine doesn't always manage to produce an output that
    satisfies the thin bots check, even when it produces a manifold output.
    Check the repaired output, and only replace the original manifold result
    with the new BoT when it passes the thin faces check.  Note in the
    verbose log what happened.
    
    We need to be more aggressive in the librt routine - filtering out
    first-hit misses results in our not seeing some problems that the repair
    routine can handle (the havoc windows are a case in point.)

    Add a way to turn off the bot_fixup step - in case the repair logic has trouble with an input, we need a way to skip it and get whatever output the other routines can generate.  Even if it's not usable as-is, the unaltered output may be the best starting point for repair work.

    lint option added, and bot decimate -f does appear to be useful for such cases.

commit 71388eeb8dada4c55d7cdad58bb158df562174a9
Author: Clifford Yapp <238416+starseeker@users.noreply.github.com>

    Add an option to limit lint reporting based on triangle size
    
    We can't do it for all shotlines - if we miss a small triangle somewhere other
    than at the shotline origin, we won't know about it in the callbacks - but add
    an option to allow users to avoid reporting issues when the source triangles
    have a small area.
    
    In principle this shouldn't ever be necessary, but sufficiently small triangles
    are currently a problem for librt's BoT intersection routines and given we're
    deliberately sampling *every* triangle we're guaranteed to report all BoTs with
    such small triangles as invalid even if a ray hitting such a small face is
    highly improbable.
    
    Reporting the errors remains the default behavior, since the mesh in question
    really isn't behaving the way the raytracer expects even if it's a raytracing
    problem rather than a geometric problem per say, but this option gives users a
    way to determine what category of problem they are seeing and decide if the
    circumstances warrant using decimating to try and clear the small triangles.
    
    (Note: in testing, bot decimate -f 0.005 was able to produce a valid bot by
    clearing a small triangle, but the -e OpenMesh-based option isn't producing
    manifold output and doesn't repair successfully... arrgh.)

    Support nuanced controls for specifying lint methods.
    
    Added support for optional technique specifiers to lint -I option.  It's not
    required, but if specific techniques are specified only those will be used for
    testing.  Goal is to allow visualization of specific categories of BoT problem
    faces.

    Add a visualize option to lint
    
    We want to be able to see where the problem triangles in a mesh are, and we
    have enough information from the raytrace to be able to do so.  Set up a
    -V option for lint to allow plotting of problematic faces.
    
    Ideally we probably want the -I option to lint to allow for more specialization
    - i.e., only run one specific type of BoT check, for example.  This will need
    some sort of flexible test specification mechanism.

    Rough in bot plot subcommand
    
    For now this is just plotting faces by index.  Need to think about
    whether it makes sense to support plotting vertices as well - that might
    be less useful, since if we can retrieve a vertex's coordinates by index
    it would be trivial to either move the view center to that point or make
    a sphere there...
    
    On a related note - probably need to adjust the bot get syntax. Right
    now it's property then objname, but if we want to upgrade it to allow
    getting per face and per vertex info we need the property to optionally
    have arguments - that would make more sense in a "bot get objname prop
    [opt]" layout.

    Set up libged lint cmd versions of checks
    
    We're going to want more powerful reporting and visualization than makes
    sense for librt.  Reduce the bot check there to just the one facetize
    uses, and shift the more extensive logic into lint.  If we want to set
    up for things like json logging, visualization of problem triangles,
    etc. it makes more sense to do it in the lint command rather than trying
    to shoehorn it into the librt API, at least in the early stages.  If
    something emerges that makes sense in librt we can move it back later.

    Fix bots.sh regression script
    
    Since bot flip is typically used only to repair an inside-out bot, we
    need to explicitly update the orientation in a case where we are
    intentionally creating a cw bot.
    
    Previously the rt_bot_flip function was also swapping the orientation.

    Should probably explore what sort of correctness check we can do on the facetization results with shotlining.  rtcheck on two copies of a bad mesh visually showed 'missing' areas where there should have been overlaps and weren't - we might be able to use original facetization inputs as a 'ground truth' check to make sure our solid shotlines from the bots seem sane.

    Experiment with looking 'above' the triangles.
    
    Studying the r.rot348 havoc example, I'm becoming convinced CSG
    intervention is the only practical way to resolve interior triangle
    issues like that.  We'll go ahead and attempt repairs, since some
    categories of problem can be fixed that way, but resolving the rot348
    case would require (at a minimum) removing all the coplanar triangles
    involved in the interference, which center ray testing won't catch, and
    even then it might be too much for the hole filling algorithm.

    Add some notes about further testing needed.
    
    The repair step isn't clearing all issues despite reporting valid
    meshes, and examination reveals that's because of interior coplanar
    faces impacting solid shotline results.  We'll need to find a way to
    identify not just the thin triangles filling holes, but also the
    interior triangles messing with shotline results.  The latter are less
    startling visually but arguably much more important analytically, since
    they will negatively impact things like rtweight.
    
    It looks as if hit_surfno is recording the triangles associated with
    hits, so we should have enough info to identify our problem areas if we
    shoot the right rays.  More work ahead.

    Expose the "remove degenerate thickness faces" feature as a "bot strip" subcommand
    
    Even if the default settings aren't able to repair these meshes, it may be that
    manual intervention with more aggressive bot repair settings can.  Failing
    that, this allows the modeler to remove the problematic faces and prepare a BoT
    for export to other tools for additional repair work.  For that reason, no
    attempt is made to automatically repair the output as part of the strip process
    - if there are any problematic triangles, the resulting bot will be
    non-manifold until repaired.
    
    Going ahead and defining this command rather than capturing the intermediate
    results from facetize to avoid complexity in the facetize code, as well as
    provide more flexibility for users.
    
    The lint command can produce a list of bot objects that will make sense to
    consider as possible inputs for this command.  Note that providing non-manifold
    inputs to this command will likely remove triangles in unexpected ways since
    there is a risk that the rays shotting from the triangles centers will have
    nothing on the opposite side of the mesh to hit.

    shift readParameter logic into Options class
    
    readParameters deals exclusively with Options setting / validation so
    add it as a class member instead of handling in main.
    
    refactor option parsing to use BU_OPT table. Some of the options dont
    feel quite right yet, so this will allow flexible modifaction should it
    become necessary.
    would it be worth refactoring 'set' functions to be used as the BU_OPT
    callbacks? It'd clean up some of the post option checks..

    Add a lint check for bots with thin face thicknesses
    
    Although the Manifold boolean usually succeeds, it sometimes does so
    when faced with coplanar faces by producing extremely close together
    faces that raytrace with zero thickness but still show up as hits in
    nirt and when drawing the geometry.
    
    We test for this case by finding the center point of each triangle,
    backing it off slightly from the triangle plane, and shooting in the
    opposite direction of the triangle normal into the mesh.  We then check
    the first partition distance to see if that face is part of one of these
    degenerate volume pairings.  If such a case is found, abort the test and
    report a problem case.
    
    The "fix" for this is typically going to be to tweak the parent CSG
    solid definitions to avoid the coplanar faces.  It's probable the zero
    distance partitions can also be filtered and ignored analytically in the
    solid shotlining cases (rtweight, for example, won't add weight from a
    zero length segment), but they remain a visual distraction.
    Topologically these *are* valid meshes, but if we can it would be good
    to find a way to eliminate the coplanarity artifacts.
    
    One possibility that suggests itself, given the new repair capabilities,
    would be to analyze all faces on the mesh and flag any with this
    characteristic for removal.  We could then apply the bot repair logic to
    the mesh with the zero distance faces removed to create a new valid
    manifold.  Need to experiment and see if that would work - not entirely
    sure if the repair logic could handle the sort of inputs that process
    would produce.

    Add a way to determine if a BoT is inside-out
    
    Usually we end up spotting these cases when a shaded solid drawing winds
    up black instead of red, even with no color set on the object.  Add a
    way to programmatically detect when this is happening, so we can try to
    either do something about it automatically or at least report the
    situation to the modeler without them having to manually draw and
    inspect the solids to spot it.

    Fix shaded drawing of BoTs in CW mode
    
    Noticed this working with bot flip - the bot flip code (incorrectly, as
    it happens, given the intent there) was changing the orientation of the
    bot from RT_BOT_CCW to RT_BOT_CW, but the shaded display was still
    showing the bot as inside-out even though the orientation on the
    "flipped" geometry was in fact changed.  Dug a bit, and the poly drawing
    routine was ignoring the orientation flag when supplying drawing
    instructions.

    lots of archer editing now results in runtime errors.
    
    in preference/value/expediency order, we'll need to map them in ged, revert their ged_exec, or remove the functionality entirely.  seeing as the editing features are valuable progress towards scriptability, probably best to map them as commands and ideally put testing in place that indicates their use in archer.

    Adjust bot repair to accept multiple inputs
    
    The most common use case for this is most likely going to be "I have a
    .g file, fix all the BoTs in it."  Update the usability of the bot
    repair command accordingly - now "bot repair *" will try to repair all
    the BoT solids in a database.  For the case where a user wants to write
    the repair of a single bot to an object name, the -o option is now
    available rather than using an optional second argument.

    Update src/bext submodule to get librt+geogram gchecker fix
    
    It turns out the gchecker failure in Windows Release mode was due to
    linking in a geogram built without the win32 building patches.
    
    The symptoms were that gchecker would launch but hang, with bu_parallel
    launching its threads but failing to start its workers successfully.
    Even commenting out the actual guts of the work function still resulted
    in hanging, indicating the problem was with the parallelism itself.
    Bisecting identified the commit merging bext usage into the facetize
    branch as the point where the regression first appeared, and commenting
    out the librt usage of geogram in that commit resulted in success.
    
    dumpbin /dependents geogram.dll on the failing geogram build produced a
    very short dependencies list, which may be related.  In any case, it
    looks like the latest bext patch does succeed in allowing gchecker to
    run again.

    See if we can add /DEBUG to Release MSVC build
    
    Grr.  Getting a regress-gchecker failure unique to Release mode -
    libanalyze perform_raytracing function calls bu_parallel, and in Release
    mode on Windows everything hangs.  Doesn't appear to be related to the
    contents of analyze_worker - commenting out its internals and making it
    a no-op doesn't alleviate the hanging, but launching bu_parallel with
    ncpus==1 succeeds.  Haven't been able to get a backtrace so far.  Trying
    this, even though early results don't seem to be too promising...
    
    Failure is especially bizarre since parallel rt is still succeeding.
    There must be a setup difference somewhere.

    We were getting the following warning in Release mode with gcc on Linux:
    
    src/libbrep/cdt/fast.cpp:2067:97: error: argument 1 value
    ‘18446744073709551615’ exceeds maximum object size 9223372036854775807

    To avoid this we instead make a pointer array and create the

    wouldn't have gotten big enough to produce an array object that would
    hit this limit, but in principle it IS possible (i.e. the data types
    don't preclude it.)

    Replace poly2tri with detria
    
    This logic is exposed via the e -m1 shaded drawing and brep->bot
    facetization routines.  The latter aren't working for most inputs at the
    moment with either triangulator (need to fix that, but that logic is a
    deep dive so it will have to be later).  However, testing a couple of
    basic primitive->brep->bot conversions confirms we ARE able to get
    triangles out with the new detria logic in this pipeline when the
    inputs aren't problematic for other reasons.
    
    More significant at the moment is the use of this triangulation for
    interactive shaded display of NURBS brep geometry, and in testing so far
    the speed appears to be on the same order as poly2tri and the results
    are either comparable or (in a couple of cases) actually better. A
    conversion of the GrabCAD model YachtMod(55).3dm resulted in inputs that
    resulted in the poly2tri-backed draw crashing but the detria-backed draw
    succeeding.
    
    Give detria appears to *fix* a drawing problem, that's motivation for
    switching it in.  Although not decisive in and of itself, another
    convenient benefit of this switch will be eliminating the need for our
    forked copy of poly2tri (we have diverged from upstream, and the last
    attempt at using vanilla upstream poly2tri resulted in unsuccessful
    shading results for various NURBS surfaces.)

    Merge new facetize work into main
    
    distcheck-full is now passing - merge the facetize branch back into
    main.  This work improves the conversion success rate of facetize in BoT
    mode significantly - although the process is slow, on Linux we have
    successfully run conversion.sh --bot MAXTIME=5000 against all of the .g
    example files in share/db and the share/db/* subfolders.
    
    Need to do more usability cleanup - improve user messages, make sure
    documentation is up to date, etc. - but things seem to be doing well
    enough now that we can avoid the overhead of working in a branch while
    tying up the lose ends.

    Realign distcheck tests for bext build testing
    
    The enableall and autodetect settings in the original tests aren't
    directly relevant for all cases now, but they do have analogs if the
    configure process is responsible for building bext rather than re-using
    the parent supplied files.
    
    Set up some additional tests to try and cover the configure-driven bext
    cases, and explicitly pass BRLCAD_EXT_DIR for the others rather than
    hard coding it into the test templates.
    
    Also simply definition of distcheck target.  distcheck-full is what we
    use to actually test - the shorter list of configurations originally
    defined for distcheck-std is not used in practice.  If any of the
    distcheck-full configurations is broken, that identifies an issue we
    need to fix - rather than defining a macro and getting fancy, just
    specify the configurations and targets we actually use.

    Rework gqa plot testing into a regression test
    
    These tests will trigger the cache logic, so rework them into a
    regression test were we can use BU_DIR_CACHE to localize the cache
    activity.
    
    This seems to be the last functional issue for make check to work (at
    least on Linux) when disabling the man user cache.  That should imply
    that the build and check process is now localized, and we won't have
    tests and multiple builds all trying to pile into the global cache at
    once.
    
    The way this was tested was 1) removing the .cache/BRL-CAD directory and
    replacing it with a file (i.e. ensuring that any attempt to work with
    the standard cache location would fail) and 2) altering cache.c in librt
    to make any failure to set up the cache immediately fatal.  If we don't
    do that, then the uncached behavior is used and everything still works -
    but for this case, we wanted specifically to identify cases where we
    didn't have localized cache logic, so we needed an immediate failure.

    Do a little bit of cleanup on the distcheck tgts
    
    With bext coming online, there are some implications for distcheck.  An
    earlier commit instructed the distcheck builds to re-use the bext
    provided by the parent build, and that's an overall BIG win, but in the
    (so far theoretical) case where we try to get distcheck working on
    Windows, it won't fly due to the Debug/Release incompatibility problem.
    When the time comes we'll have to engineer so we can both reuse when
    possible and build when necessary, but for the moment we just skip
    defining the targets where we can't use them (and where they weren't
    known to be working anyway.)
    
    Also remove the bundled libs control variables - we no longer specify
    that at the BRL-CAD configure stage.
    
    Definitely more work to do here - post-build cleanup is well and truly
    busted by the bext copies, so it looks like the distclean logic didn't
    get the memo.  Also need to clean up the pkgIndex and tclIndex files
    properly after that logic was reworked.

    Address issue with getModulePath and odd pathnames
    
    whereami.c uses sscanf to break up and parse a map file on Linux, and
    the odd pathnames test wound up detecting that the code wasn't returning
    the full path when there was a space in it (which is expected behavior
    when using %s with sscanf - it treats spaces as delimiters.)
    
    Using a hint from https://stackoverflow.com/a/50440783/2037687 we change
    this logic to instead read the full remaining contents of the line for
    the path.

    Update libged drawing tests that use facetization
    
    The new facetize setup results in slightly different triangles being
    produced for moss geometries, which in turn means the images are
    slightly different.  Output names of subtree objects are also different,
    so update select callouts accordingly.
    
    To really do this right these tests should set up caches local to the
    build directory so multiple builds can't interfere with facetize
    outputs - TODO notes added.

    Only use subprocess.h where we need to

    Use Chris's updates to subprocess.h to launch ged_tessellate
    
    OK, so this is a little complicated... the current iteration of the
    libbu process API doesn't include support for async reads.  The changes
    for doing so are rather invasive, and given the other cleanup work it
    would be a lot to try to add them until the dust has settled.
    
    Chris also did some work to pull in the upstream proposed patch for Unix
    async I/O support and also worked to get subprocess.h to handle async on
    Windows - while not yet passing all the upstream tests, he did meet with
    some success.  We will try that version of subprocess.h for launching
    the ged_tessellate executable, and experiment with the async I/O
    capabilities it provides.  This is a self-contained change for just
    facetize - the other libbu changes are unaffected.
    
    Async I/O is of particular interest in this situation because we want to
    eventually provide more useful intermediate status info from
    ged_tessellate to its parent as it is working.  We need an async read
    capabilities for that, since there is no guarantee ged_tessellate will
    produce output at all and we can't have the parent libged hanging
    indefinitely waiting for input that might not come.

    cleanup commented out code
    
    after further testing, it looks like we can get away with checking the
    WNOHANG wait() as long as we protect the bu_process_wait from re-waiting
    on the same pid.
    
    only caveat is the alive check could now end up 'eating' the error code
    from being returned by process_wait().. not sure there's a clean way to
    avoid that

    wip - update 'alive' checking on linux
    
    kill(pid, 0) is not quite enough for our use cases. If a process
    finishes, it will still report alive until it is waited on - which is
    not what we want. Instead, attempt to wait on the process and report
    that status as its alive state.
    
    Still need to test to make sure we can't double wait (ie infinite hang) on a
    process that's been waited for in 'alive' before calling bu_process_wait

    Add examples of using presets with BRLCAD_EXT_DIR
    
    Since it will be a recommended/common pattern to build bext once and
    reuse it many times, it will probably make sense for developers to
    utilize CMakeUserPresets.json to make the configure process smoother and
    easier to use (as opposed to having to type out the location of
    BRLCAD_EXT_DIR each time.)  Provide a couple minimalist examples of json
    files set up to do this.

    CMakePresets.json is apparently intended to be used for cases where project-wide setting defaults might want to be defined.  I can thing of a few cases where we might want to do that - for exmaple, it's one potential way to encode the configuration options used by the distcheck-full builds - so let's not ignore it.  Also explain a little more about where some of these ignore file patterns are coming from.

    Force all CMake generators to use one configuration
    
    With the switch to bext, the configure process (in some modes) needs to
    build bext itself.  This means with MSVC we can't switch the build type
    from Debug to Release at build time, since Debug bext binaries aren't
    usable with Release BRL-CAD build outputs and vice versa.  Even with a
    pre-defined BRLCAD_EXT_DIR, that directory will hold only one
    configuration of the bext binaries and we still won't be able to do
    a Debug/Release build time switch.
    
    If we wanted the configure process in a multiconfig build environment to
    pre-build and manage all possible configurations of bext (which can be
    as many as 4, if we use the CMake pre-defined build configurations) we
    would have a huge problem in terms of build logic complexity, disk space
    and configure time requirements as we built multiple copies of
    potentially all of bext.  This isn't worthwhile just to be able to
    select between Debug and Release at built time, when we can just set up
    two build directories to achieve the same result and avoid the whole
    problem.
    
    To constrain BRL-CAD's build to the desired behavior, we need to
    simplify what configurations are allowed for a single configure+build
    setup by overriding CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES.  As a bonus, we can also
    eliminate a lot of logic that was added specifically to support BRL-CAD
    being runnable in per-configuration build directories.  Needs to be
    tested with Visual Studio to make sure we've successfully cleared the
    old logic out correctly and set up the necessary output directory
    variable overrides to make things work like a single-config tool, but
    in the end this should be a lot easier to deal with across the board.

    some features, like alive checking and termination, are preferable to
    access via a process ID rather than the process struct. To make the API
    uniform, break these tools out into a new prefix: bu_pid instead of
    bu_process.
    
    Also update return and input types to pid_t for extra clarity.

    bot extrude enhancement to produce an evaluated BoT
    
    Taking advantage of the Manifold boolean abilities, we are able to
    properly realize the "bot extrude" feature and produce a mesh that is
    the result of the evaluated CSG tree of primitives generated to
    represent the implicit volume of a plate mode BoT explicitly.  The comb
    tree that was previously produced can still be generated with the -C
    option, but this is not recommended as those comb trees can be very
    large and difficult to work with.
    
    For large plate mode BoTs the extrusion process may be rather slow - the
    boolean problem involved with evaluating the union of all individual
    elements of the extrusion is difficult - but the output should be a
    properly manifold representation of the plate mode volume.
    
    Note that the output volume is ultimately an approximation of the
    implicit plate mode volume - even in the simplest cases there can be
    view dependent behavior of plate mode BoTs depending on incoming ray
    angles.  Plate modes where the hit distance is always extruded out in
    the direction of the ray are ignored - such behaviors are not
    representable with volumetric geometry, and the standard "extrude in
    both directions from the middle" volume will be generated regardless.

    Expose the Manifold check as a bot check cmd
    
    Manifold library's validity testing is key for determining whether a
    given BoT is viable for boolean evaluation, so wire it in to the bot
    check command.  It's added to the default checks and "solid" (solid is
    the test implicitly selected when no specific test is asked for.)  The
    specific Manifold test can also be run in isolation with the "manifold"
    subcommand:
    
       bot check manifold input.bot
    
    A warning will be printed if BRL-CAD's routines and Manifold disagree -
    such a case probably warrants investigation to see if there is a
    problem in either testing setup.

    Add bot repair command to expose Geogram hole filling
    
    The "repair" subcommand to the libged "bot" command will check if a mesh
    is manifold.  If not, it tries to use the Geogram library's hole filling
    routines to produce a manifold mesh.  It can either write out the new
    mesh in-place, or to a user-supplied object name.
    
    Note that this is intended to repair relatively small holes in nearly
    manifold meshes - if a mesh is sufficiently messy, the original modeling
    intent is lost and even a "repaired" mesh may not be very representative
    of what an actual human modeler would have reconstructed.

    This is the core logic used to apply Geogram's hole filling algorithm to
    rt_bot_internal data.  At some point we'll probably want to allow
    passing in a threshold parameter to control how aggressive the hole
    filling should be - right now it basically tries to fill ANY hole.

    Adjust messaging based on whether src/bext is populated

commit 0286b6e72dea8678ad48438ce1bba6652f5d91de
Author: Clifford Yapp <238416+starseeker@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 16 19:25:49 2024 -0400

    Check to see if a populated src/bext is up to date
    
    Because git submodules always point to a specific SHA1, there's no way
    to tell src/bext to always pull the latest checkout of RELEASE when
    doing the "git clone --recurse-submodules" checkout.  Since bext and
    brlcad are decoupled, updating BRL-CAD/bext's RELEASE branch won't
    automatically update the src/bext submodule.  In order to keep the two
    in sync, in the cases where we have an internet connection validate the
    local submodule SHA1 against the bext RELEASE branch's latest SHA1.
    It's not a fatal error - we just warn if there's a mismatch and advise
    updating src/bext to point to the latest.
    
    In the case of a checkout of a release tag of BRL-CAD, src/bext should
    be pointed to the equivalent rel-X-Y-Z branch of bext rather than
    RELEASE.  Accordingly, we also check for that case if the RELEASE SHA1
    doesn't match before concluding there's a problem.

    Set up bext as a submodule in src
    
    A default "git clone" of BRL-CAD will not populate bext, so the more
    minimal configure-driven "clone only what you need" process will still
    be the default.  However, since that requires an internet connection to
    work, we also want to make it as easy as possible to get a "full"
    checkout of all the necessary sources, and setting up a submodule will
    allow for the possibility of a "one shot clone everything" process with:
    
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad.git
    
    This will result in a large checkout, since all the Appleseed and OSPray
    dependencies will also be cloned, but it will obtain everything with one
    command.

    Update GitHub Actions workflows for bext building
    
    Phew.  This was a lot more work than expected, but looks like we now
    have a working path for building BRL-CAD with bext-based dependencies.
    Particular considerations included:
    
    1.  Had to provide an option for configure-driven bext builds to
        operation in non-parallel mode.  Parallel building was too much
        for the runners and resulted in failures (Tcl building was
        particularly fragile for some reason.)
    2.  Qt6 - for the moment, going ahead and having bext build the subset
        of Qt that we need as part of bext building.  Should probably figure
        out how to used the cached Qt for some of the tests, but the full CI
        cycle is pretty long even without the Qt build and it is nice to know
        the full bext Qt + BRL-CAD stack is at least building across the
        various CI platforms.
    3.  Space - in some tests we hit space limits for the VMs used as
        runners - being more aggressive about clearing out the bext
        source and build dirs from configure-driven builds to limit space
        consumption.
    4.  CPack - the new trick CPack was taught to bundled bext in src
        for package_source builds is murderous on hard disk space, since
        CMake isn't efficient and makes one copy of everything for each
        archive type - see https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/16249
        Probably need to make our own alternative to package_source using
        cmake -E tar so we can avoid more than one copying setup stage...
    
    It's looking like the bext find logic (and BRL-CAD's for that matter)
    may need a bit more work - a couple of Ubuntu dependency installs didn't
    seem to result in the bext build skipping those components...

    Add ifdef guarded tessellation code using detria
    
    The detria header-only implementation of CDT is looking very
    interesting.  Upstream changes made it work for a C++17 build, so add it
    to the build for more extensive testing, guarded by a USE_DETRIA ifdef
    check.
    
    Have tried a few simple cases - facetize of a brep rcc, shaded drawing
    of a few NURBS brep objects - but will need *extensive* testing to
    verify it works as we need it to, which is why it's added behind an
    ifdef conditional.  If this does pan out however, it would allow us to
    remove our older, semi-forked poly2tri version in favor of a new
    header-only implementation that is much simpler to integrate.  Upstream
    testing results suggest it may also be somewhat faster.

    Make sure the clone is in the binary directory - if cmake is run from somewhere else and specifying the build directory via options, we need to be explicit about this.  Not doing so resulted in a bext configure attempt finding the top level CMakeLists.txt file from brlcad again and re-running that configure.  Noticed it in CI testing when we were losing a setting, but consequences were probably wilder than just that...

    Remove the src/other and misc/tools/ext dirs
    
    The motivation for doing this is to fully decouple our third party
    bulding logic from BRL-CAD's primary build and allow our use of third
    party components to scale beyond just what is feasible within our main
    tree.  Integration of independent build systems has always been a source
    of issues, and when it comes to very large prospective dependencies
    (Boost, LLVM, Qt, etc.) our existing approaches simply weren't
    practical.  Consequently, a new appoach was developed - using a
    completely separate repository to focus solely on the management of
    third party components.  In this new scheme the only role BRL-CAD's
    build system has is to copy and bundle provided third party outputs, as
    well as pointing CMake's "find_package" logic preferentially to those
    local copies if they are present.  The new "gist" tool already depends
    on this approach when bundling OpenCV; that dependency was never
    integrated into src/other/ext, and so requires either a system version
    or a bext-based build.  There is also additional experimental code in
    branches and off-by-default compilation units that already depends on
    bext.
    
    In bext-based compilation, if user does nothing to specify any bext
    inputs the BRL-CAD configure process will attempt to do its own clone,
    configure, and build of the elements of bext necessary for the current
    build configuration, based on the configuration settings.  If a
    pre-existing copy of the bext source tree is present in an expected
    location, the clone step can be skipped - otherwise a network
    connection must be present to download the sources.  If BRL-CAD's
    configure is doing the configure+build steps for bext, it will enable
    only the necessary compoennts.
    
    If the user has a pre-compiled bext output directory they wish the build
    to use, rather than building components as part of configure, the
    BRLCAD_EXT_DIR variable may be used to point the build to that tree.
    Note that in that mode, BRL-CAD's build will bundled whatever files are
    present in the provided outputs - for example, if Qt6 is present in the
    bext output directory specified but BRL-CAD's BRLCAD_ENABLE_QT feature
    is off, a generated output package will still contain Qt6 even though it
    is unused per the BRL-CAD configure and build settings.
    
    We have been working to shift our CMake build logic from in-tree
    src/other and misc/tools/ext directories to pulling from the
    https://github.com/BRL-CAD/bext respository.  Logic is already in place
    to support the latter, conditionalized on whether src/other and
    misc/tools/ext are present in the source tree.
    
    By removing these two directories, we are making the bext logic "live" -
    testing has gone well thus far, so it is time to iron out any remaining
    practical issues with this approach.

    Revert "db_free_tree handles the nmg_kr calls"
    
    Caught by Sean - the facetize logic in main does need these calls to
    avoid leaking memory.
    
    This reverts commit 1602a19e0b32f9261f348fe3893b6f86efc6b954.

    This reverts "Remove the old autotools pc.in files" (commit
    48bc30b152c6867deea393a0a6a03d4db4f10fe3) but also notes that we have
    some work to do if we want to properly integrate these with the CMake
    build logic.  In an ideal world these should probably be an output
    of BRLCAD_ADDLIB.

    Consoliate find_package resets into BRLCAD_Find_Package
    
    Per suggestion from Sean, most (but not all) of the find_package cases respect
    a similar pattern.  Rather than have one macro per package, it would be better
    to make a generic wrapper that handles most of the cases and use it.
    
    The key to making this work is the CACHE_VARIABLES directory property, which
    gives us a way to get a "before and after" insight into what a find_package
    call has done to the cache.  Once we know that, we can use unset(CACHE) to
    clear those values from the cache.  We also make sure to save and then restore
    the values to the working variable state, so we don't destroy the find_package
    results for the working session.
    
    We do, however, still need something in the cache so the BRL-CAD Summary
    printing knows what happened - the find_package variables are scoped in their
    calling directories and aren't directly visible.  To handle this, we write out
    a *_STATUS variable for each package and teach the Summary logic to look for
    it.  The *_STATUS variable isn't functional, so it is harmless as far as
    find_package is concerned, but it still gives us what we need for the final
    summary.  Nor does it matter that the value will be overwritten by mulitple
    calls, since the results of multiple BRLCAD_Find_Package calls with the same
    package should always be the same.  (If not, it is an error.)

    Try a different approach to tclIndex/pkgIndex
    
    We're still getting occasional problems with errors generating these
    files in parallel builds.  Take the build targets out of the equation
    and generate a script that executes each command in order.  Then run
    that script with a single custom target and custom command.
    
    Needs testing in multiconfig environments - not sure if $<CONFIG> will
    do what needs doing here...

    We're not set up to generate these in CMake, and there doesn't seem to
    be a trivial way to extract the information from the build files in the
    format they are expecting.  Would probably be more useful to first look
    at supporting a "modern" style find_package call for BRL-CAD by
    producing the expected files in lib/cmake (needs more research.)

    Install license files based on whether they are in use per the targets.  REQUIRED target should be the lowest level target that can activate the component.  May have to make this more powerful if we need to list multiple activating targets - REQUIRED needs all the listed targets to be active, and what we would need in that case is 'at least one active.

    More logic trimming, remove the BRLCAD_IS_SUBBUILD conditionals.  We're figuring out how to use ExternalProject_Add effectively with BRL-CAD, and that seems to be the scalable approach.

    Stash an rle version of the Tk test teapot img
    
    It's looking as if we didn't hook UtahRLE conversion support into
    libicv, which means we don't currently have the ability to read and
    write them exposed in our tools - need to fix that.
    
    rle images aren't common, so we create one by using the netpbm utility
    pnmtorle to convert the Tk test image of the teapot, and then passed
    that result through the old Utahrle tools rletoraw and rawtorle.  Using
    the netpbm rletopnm to convert the result back into something viewable
    indicates the conversions were sane, so this should at least give us
    something to work with.  Also add the original Tk version of the image
    (which is already in our repo history anyway via Tk) to use as a
    control.  In principle we ought to be able to read these both in with
    libicv and get a clean diff comparison.

    With the new bext logic, modularlize/localize find
    
    misc/CMake/BRLCAD_ExternalDeps.cmake holds the find_package logic for
    the bext components, but for a modular build we don't want to be doing
    all the find_package calls right away.  If some components are disabled
    we never need to look for their dependencies at all.
    
    To make this work, we define macros that encapsulate what is needed for
    a resettable find process for each package (we use macros rather than
    functions deliberately here, otherwise the function scope encapsulates
    the find_package output variables and we would have to PARENT_SCOPE
    export the ones we care about - that's possible, but for now it's extra
    work and we can do it later if it looks like it would be beneficial.)
    
    The new macros are then called in the subdirectories where those
    packages are actually needed/used.  Because the scope of the
    find_package results isn't global except for variables being written to
    the cache, we call the macros separately in the various places we need
    them, but that should be acceptable - the results should always be the
    same, and the extra work of repeating the finds is minimal compared to
    the overall build and modularity benefits.
    
    This lets us build (for example) librt and its dependencies with:
    
    cmake .. -DBRLCAD_COMPONENTS=librt && make -j3
    
    If we let the BRL-CAD cmake configure also do its own bext build, it
    will try to enable only the bext dependencies needed for the active
    configuration (a pre-supplied bext, on the other hand, is what it is -
    the logic will not try to pick and choose just the files needed from an
    already created output directory, as there is no way to reliably tell
    what is needed and what isn't.)
    
    The next step is probably to look at whether it makes sense to push the
    various configure checks for headers and functions down closer to where
    they are needed as well.  That would probably mean revisiting
    brlcad_config.h - we'd either need to define private headers for the
    various individual libs and programs to use instead, or supply command
    line defines (the latter might make more sense if we only have a small
    number of defines relevant to a particular component.)  Would also need
    to determine which parts of brlcad_config.h really need to be part of
    the install, and which parts are build-time only.

    Look for a BRLCAD_ENABLE_APPLESEED flag to do the full Appleseed build stack with the configure bext checkout/build (enabling this, especially with ENABLE_ALL, will result in a VERY long configure...)

    Use BEFORE for most of the local target_include_directories additions.

    Do header sorting in per-target assignment setup
    
    We don't want to give up the preferential ordering we had established
    for our local headers with the previous include scheme, so rather than
    using generator expressions (which offer no opportunity to arrange
    the order of accumulated headers) we read the target properties and
    build up include lists that can be sorted at configure time.
    
    Probably worth examining more closely which headers end up in public and
    private groupings - not sure manifold and poly2tri need to be in public,
    for example - but for now this builds.
    
    TODO: Individual additions to the exec includes probably should be
    specifying the BEFORE property to make sure they receive preferential
    ordering, unless we're locally adding a system find_package result...

    Rework BRLCAD_ADDLIB to use target_include_dirs
    
    Modern CMake practice uses target properties for include dirs, rather
    than per-directory includes.  This is a significant change to the
    BRL-CAD CMake logic, so start in a contained fashion with BRLCAD_ADDLIB.
    
    The idea is to propagate the interface includes of dependencies using
    these properties, rather than having to explicitly list them out.  Logic
    should be more compact overall, as well as letting us more precisely
    target include dirs to their intended targets even when there are
    multiple targets defined in one directory.

    Test mechanism to optionally require targets to build man pages
    
    This will need some thought, since we originally consolidated the man
    page targets to avoid exploding the target count in Visual Studio, but
    to support a cleaner modular build we need to avoid building man pages
    or things that have been disabled.
    
    One possibility might be to handle the Docbook building right in the
    BRLCAD_ADDEXEC and/or plugin functions and make them part of the main
    exec/plugin build.

    Prototype a more modularized build approach
    
    Instead of the three levels previously defined, explore supporting
    specifying one or more "components" of BRL-CAD to be enabled.  The idea
    would be that if a user defines (say) -DBRLCAD_COMPONENTS=librt then
    only librt and its dependencies would be enabled for compilation.
    
    For this to be properly realized a lot of higher level build logic will
    have to be conditionalized based on whether various targets are
    available (for example, regression tests will need to be disabled if
    their executables aren't defined as targets) but this should let us be
    way more flexible when it comes to "only build what we want" situations.

    Update behavior of dbconcat command's prefix/suffix application
    
    Previously, when the user suffied a prefix or suffix string to dbconcat,
    it would always apply the prefix and suffix to all incoming object
    names, regardless of whether the incoming name conflicted with any
    object already in the database.  While there are potential scenarios
    where this property is useful - it is one potential way to identify
    objects that came from the concated database - it is a hinderance when
    the goal is to merge the incoming geometry with a minimum of renaming
    but using less generic alteration strings than the default no
    prefix/suffix dbconcat naming behavior.
    
    What we do if a user prefix/suffix is specified by default is to only
    use it for renaming if we need to in order to resolve a naming conflict.
    If the user wishes to have the previous "always applied" behavior, they
    can get it by adding the -A option flag along with the prefix/suffix
    option.
    
    The initial motivation for this is the use of the new facetize command
    implementation's region mode, which operates on a working copy and then
    dbconcats the result back into the original file.  We want to prefix the
    copies of the top level combs, but not (unless necessary) the new BoT
    solid primitives, which usually will have no corresponding conflicting
    object in the original file.
