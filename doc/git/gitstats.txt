If we want a more comprehensive presentation of the statistics of our git
history than those of Github (which bases its reporting only on commits in
main) the best tool I've found thus far looks to be gitstats:

https://github.com/tomgi/git_stats

After installing, statistics pages can be generated by running:

git_stats generate

in a clone of the repository.



Note - on Ubuntu, per https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/34822 I had to add
the line:

gem 'bigdecimal', '1.4.2'

to the git_stats file

/var/lib/gems/2.7.0/gems/git_stats-1.0.17/bin/git_stats

and install the older version of bigdecimal (per https://stackoverflow.com/a/17026442):

gem install bigdecimal -v 1.4.2
