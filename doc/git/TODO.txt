One of the major concerns with using submodules is that they
encode the URLs of the submodule repositories in our main
git repository's history.  Thus, if we ever need to shift
hosting sites, or want to work with a completely local mirror
of our repository and its dependencies, those URLs would be
a problem.  Nor would rewriting them be easy, since the SHA1
hashing mechanism of git has backed the existing URLs into
the hashes - trying to replace and propagate them in the
history would be a difficult rewrite problem.

One possibility would be to redirect the github URLs locally,
if that is supported.  Need to experiment with
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60057790/how-to-make-git-to-redirect-an-url-to-a-local-path
and confirm whether that can work for our setup - if so, need
to make a worked example of how to do it for potential later
use.

That won't auto-correct the CMake logic that uses the github
URL to clone, so it's not a completely drop-in solution (although
perhaps we could have the CMake logic check for such a redirect
in the .git config files...) but it would still be much better
than nothing.
