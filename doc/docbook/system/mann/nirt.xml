<refsection xml:id="description"><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
	<para>
		Runs the <command>nirt(1)</command> command line program that is distributed with
		BRL-CAD to intersect a single ray with the objects currently being displayed in the
		active view. By default, when <command>nirt(n)</command> (the GED level command) is
		run the current database is used and the objects currently displayed in the scene are
		the active object set.  The default starting point for the ray is the current center
		point in the view, however - as with <command>nirt(1)</command>  - by default the ray origin
		point is backed out until it is outside the geometry.  The current viewing direction
		is used as the ray direction.
	</para>
	<para>
		Intuitively, what this means is the NIRT ray is fired "into" the center of the display. The
		resulting collection of intersections between the ray and the objects is returned as
		textual output, and by default the hit segments and gaps are plotted in the view.
	</para>
	<para>
		When in the graphics window, the hot key <emphasis>N</emphasis> will run
		<command>nirt</command> command with no arguments at the center of the screen.
	</para>
	<para>
		Additional arguments may be supplied on the command line. See the
		<command>nirt(1)</command> man page for documentation of available options - with the
		exception of specifying a different .g file, options available on the nirt(1) command
		line should also be available to the <command>nirt(n)</command> version.
