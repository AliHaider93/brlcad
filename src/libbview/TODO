implement general polygon creation and manipulation (point append, select, move)

migrate clipping of two or more polygons

implement labels

implement data axes

implement interactive rectangle

determine how to manage interactive rect, adc (view object or faceplate?  If latter, how to handle custom mouse reactions?)

implement xy selection via projected view plane bounding polygons of scene obj vlists (minimally convex hull,
better would be concave hull.)  Alternative method would be snapping to closest projected line seg.
