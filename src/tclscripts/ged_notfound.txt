Scanning through the BRL-CAD Tcl sources looking for mGed and gedWrapper
commands executed on the object, the following don't seem to have corresponding
GED commands - at least, they aren't present on a gsh command line.  Not
sure if the Tcl Ged object has some alternative means of making these work,
but since this is where vslew came from it warrants checking...
