write out problematic solids to combs
	- failed conversions
	- fallback conversions

log details of conversion to temporary file in cache dir, and if user requests
full log copy that to a specified file

make lint ray testing parallel - doesn't matter much for small samples, but for
large models it DOES matter.

figure out what to do about small triangles in meshes - they cause lint failures
if the raytracer can't intersect them.  Can we decimate if it looks like small
triangles are in play

investigate whether it makes sense to add a gdiff mode to validate conversions
against the original input
