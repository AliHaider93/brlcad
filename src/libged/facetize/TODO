write out problematic solids to combs
	- failed conversions
	- fallback conversions

log details of conversion to temporary file in cache dir, and if user requests
full log copy that to a specified file

large models it DOES matter.

investigate whether it makes sense to add a gdiff mode to validate conversions
against the original input
