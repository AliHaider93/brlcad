write out problematic solids to combs
	- failed conversions
	- fallback conversions

log details of conversion to temporary file in cache dir, and if user requests
full log copy that to a specified file

make lint ray testing parallel - doesn't matter much for small samples, but for
large models it DOES matter.

figure out what to do about small triangles in meshes - they cause lint failures
if the raytracer can't intersect them.  Can we decimate if it looks like small
triangles are in play

add an option to lint to filter out results based on surface area of problematic
triangles as a percentage of the total mesh area - that'll let us distinguish
between the "one tiny triangle causing raytracer trouble" vs. "serious problem
with whole mesh" cases, rather than being all or nothing

investigate whether it makes sense to add a gdiff mode to validate conversions
against the original input
