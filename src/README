BRL-CAD's source code is more than a million lines of logic spanning
over 400+ tools and more than two dozen libraries.  Most of BRL-CAD's
3rd-party dependencies are preconfigured and bundled in the "other"
subdirectory.  Public interface headers to BRL-CAD's libraries are
alongside this 'src' directory in the top-level 'include' directory.
